MIDI Sample and Test Files

This directory contains contributed MIDI files for examples and testing.
Also see the test files from the midicvt as described in
midicvt-test-files.txt; we found a few bugs to fix, and potential features
to add, by loading them into Seq66.  Some of these files have been
resaved with the new features.  For example, see the various versions of
the "example1" file.

   1Bar.midi:

      A small sample to play with.  Was also saved (accidentally)
      with a buss-override of 5, so the buss will not appear in the pattern
      editor unless it happens to exist.  Also added notes and used the LFO
      editor to set DC = 64, Mod Range = 64, Periods = 7.77, Phase Shift = 0.21,
      and Waveform = 1 (Sine wave).  Also added some extra notes after
      modulation, which shows that we do not handle two different velocities at
      the same time value.

   2Bars.midi:

      A 2-bar sample.  Also shows different values of velocity, but added
      via the mouse on the data pane.

   2rock.mid:

      This drum file we found has "Lyric" sections in it that broke
      reading of the MIDI file.  So this is a new test case.  It resulted
      in a fix to the handling of running status.

   allofarow.mid:

      A file having a lot of empty tracks and one filled track.
      In Sequencer64, it loads as 140 BPM, but plays really slowly.
      In seq24, it loads as 120 BPM, but plays somewhat normally!

   click_4_4.midi:
   
      Holds a click-track for use with the Seq24-session script.

   mutes-long.midi:

      This tune has 10 mute-groups saved in the old mute-group format,
      where each mute-group setting is represented by a long integer
      value!

   mutes-test.midi:

      This is the same tune as above, but saved in the new mute-group
      format, where only a byte is used.  Saves 3168 bytes!

   reset.mid:
   
      A file that resets all MIDI channels.

   CountryStrum.midi:

      This file is the CountryStrum.mid SMF 0 file imported into
      Sequencer64, with the SMF 0 track removed, and all the sequences
      moved over to the leftmost position in the main window.

   NR_Route_66.midi:

      An excerpt from the Nelson Riddle version of "Route 66", which
      inspired me to name "Seq66", and give it a street-sign logo.

   route66.midi:

      A version more like the original.

Also see the "data/midi" directory which contains some MIDI/WRK files that get
installed.  Also see the Sequencer64 project for a lot more sample files
and test files.
