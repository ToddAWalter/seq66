# These variable values are new with seq66.

load-key-control = true
load-midi-control = true

# The leftmost number on each line here is the pattern number, from
# 0 to 31; or it is the group number, from 32 to 63, for up to 32 
# groups; or it is an automation control number, from 64 to 95.
# This internal MIDI control number is followed by three groups of
# bracketed numbers, each providing three different type of control:
#
#    Normal:           [toggle]    [on]      [off]
#    Playback:         [pause]     [start]   [stop]
#    Playlist:         [by-value]  [next]    [previous] (if active)
#
# In each group, there are six numbers:
#
#    [on/off invert status d0 d1min d1max]
#
# 'on/off' enables/disables (1/0) the MIDI control for the pattern.
# 'invert' (1/0) causes the opposite if data is outside the range.
# 'status' is by MIDI event to match (channel is NOT ignored).
# 'd0' is the first data value.  Example: if status is 144 (Note On),
# then d0 represents Note 0.
# 'd1min'/'d1max' are the range of second values that should match.
# Example:  For a Note On for note 0, 0 and 127 indicate that any
# Note On velocity will cause the MIDI control to take effect.
#
