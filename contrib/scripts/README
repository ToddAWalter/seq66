This directory contains scripts that may be useful.  Not all of them will
work without some system setup.

binfuncs         Defines some bash functions that may be useful.
bluejack         Meant to send JACK audio to Bluetooth via "bluealsa". Painful.
debug            Provides a way to run the cgdb debugger via libtool.
htmldoc          Builds seq66.html from the TeX files of the user-manual.
                 Needs pandoc.
Jack             Stops mpd and starts JACK; uses binfuncs. No longer used.
make-checkout    Checks out Makefile.ins to preserve the canonical makes.
mutetest         Runs a test of mute groups using Yoshimi.
naming           Fixes up the names of MP3 obtained via youtube-dl.
ordercp          Copies files while preserving their name ordering a la 'ls'.
qbuild           Rebuilds portmidi or rtmidi Seq66 using qmake on Linux.
qtctrun          Runs an application using the qt5ct platform theming.
reconf           Reconstructs the GNU Autotools project files for Seq66.
seq66-nsm-proxy  A script to try to run Seq66 via nsm-proxy. No guarantees.
seq66.sed        Sed script to convert Seq64 names to Seq66 names.
                 No longer needed.
session          A new version of the Jack script above. Mostly of tutorial
                 value.
strap_functions  Provides the functions used by the bootstrap script.
timid            Starts Timidity++ using JACK/ALSA, also will kill it.
ystart           Starts Yoshimi with a GM state file from yoshimi-cookbook.
windows/VMS_fixes   Fixes the Registry for the MIDI Mapper. Use at your
                 own risk.
