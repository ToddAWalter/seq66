#
# This file holds multiple playlists, with one or more [playlist]
# sections.  Each has a user-specified number for sorting and MIDI
# control, ranging from 0 to 127. Next comes a quoted name for this
# list, followed by the quoted name of the song folder using the UNIX
# separator ('/'). It should be accessible wherever Seq66 is run.
#
# Next is a list of tunes, each starting with a MIDI control number
# and the quoted name of the MIDI file, sorted by the control number.
# They can be simple 'base.midi' file-names; the playlist directory
# is prepended to access the song. If the file-name has a path, that
# will be used.

# First provide the playlist settings, its default storage folder,
# and then list each tune with its control number. The playlist
# number is arbitrary but unique. 0 to 127 recommended for use with
# the MIDI playlist control. Similar for the tune numbers. Each 
# tune can include a path; it overrides the base directory.
