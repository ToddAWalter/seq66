# multiple mute groups. To use this file, specify it in [mute-group-file] file
# and set 'active = true'.

Currently no testing is in place for the mutes.  Soon!
  

# load-mute-groups: set to 'none', or 'mutes' to load from the 'mutes' file,
# 'midi' to load from the song, or 'both' to try to to read from 'mutes' first,
# then the 'midi' file.
#
# save-mutes-to: 'both' writes the mutes to the 'mutes' and MIDI file; 'midi'
# writes only to the MIDI file; and the mutes only to the 'mutes' file.
#
# strip-empty: If true, all-zero mute-groups are not written to the MIDI file.
#
# mute-group-rows and mute-group-columns: Specifies the size of the grid. Keep
# these values at 4 and 8; mute-group-count is only for sanity-checking.
#
# groups-format: 'binary' means write mutes as 0 or 1; 'hex' means write them as
# hexadecimal numbers (e.g. 0xff), useful for larger set sizes.
#
# mute-group-selected: if 0 to 31, and mutes are available either from this file
# or from the MIDI file, then this mute-group is applied at startup; useful in
# restoring a session. Set to -1 to disable.
#
# toggle-active-only: when a mute-group is toggled off, all patterns, even those
# outside the mute-group, are muted.  If this flag is set, only patterns in the
# mute-group are muted. Patterns unmuted directly by the user remain unmuted.

# Mute-group values are saved in the 'mutes' file, even if all zeroes. They can
# be stripped out of the MIDI file by 'strip-empty-mutes'. A hex value indicates
# a bit-mask, not a single bit. An  quoted group name can be placed at the end
# of the line.
