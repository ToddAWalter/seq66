The 4x4 Test

The 4x4 test is meant to test the following things:

   -  The usages of a 4x4 grid, without and with swapping the pattern rows
      and columns.
   -  Port-mapping, both for MIDI instrument I/O and for MIDI control and
      display.
   -  The handling of various grid modes.

By taking an existing file with a lot of empty patterns and numerous sets,
along with trying to make some changes to that file, there were some bugs
that were found and fixed, including errors in the handling of --help,
extended automation keys for grid modes, setting set 0 when opening a MIDI
file, expanding a pattern when merging a longer one into it; and pattern
access in sets > 0.

Steps:

   -  Run the following command in order to create a new configuration
      directory to hold the 4x4 test configuration. Then exit Seq66 and
      verify that the configuration files are created in that directory:

      $ qseq66 --home ~/.config/seq66/4x4

      The files created are qseq66.ctrl, qseq66.mutes, qseq66.playlist
      qseq66.usr, qseq66.drums, qseq66.palette, and, last, but not least,
      qseq66.rc.
      
      This command has to be run every time the tests are performed, because
      we currently do not have a mechanism to save the changed "home"
      configuration setting.  Maybe we need a "registry" :-D.

   -  Copy the configuration files in contrib/tests/4x4 to that directory.
      The file buff.midi will be used later, and does not need to be copied.
