This file is part of the 4x4 test. It sets the 4x4 arrangement.
 
#
# [user-midi-bus-definitions]
#
# 1. Define instruments and their control-code names, as applicable.
# 2. Define MIDI busses, names, and the instruments on each channel.
#
# Channels are counted from 0-15, not 1-16. Instruments not set here are set
# to -1 and are GM (General MIDI). These labels are shown in MIDI Clocks,
# Inputs, the pattern editor buss, channel, and event drop-downs. To disable
# entries, set counts to 0.

[user-midi-bus-definitions]

0     # number of user-defined MIDI busses

# In these MIDI instrument definitions, active (supported by the instrument)
# controller numbers are paired with the (optional) name of the controller.

[user-instrument-definitions]

0     # instrument list count

# [user-interface-settings]
#
# Configures some user-interface elements.  Obsolete ones were removed in
# version 5 of this file. Also see [user-ui-tweaks]. The grid holds Qt push-
# buttons. For styling, use Qt themes/style-sheets.
#
# 'swap-coordinates' swaps numbering so pattern numbers vary fastest by column
# instead of rows. This setting applies to the live grid, mute-group buttons,
# and set-buttons.
#
# 'mainwnd-rows' and 'mainwnd-columns' (option '-o sets=RxC') specify
# rows/columns in the main grid. R ranges from 4 to 8, C from 4 to 12.
# Values other than 4x8 have not been tested thoroughly.
#
# 'mainwnd-spacing' is for grid buttons; from 0 to 16, default = 2.
#
# 'default-zoom' is the initial zoom for piano rolls. From 1 to 512, default
# = 2. Larger PPQNs require larger zoom to look good. Seq66 adapts the zoom to
# the PPQN if set to 0. The unit of zoom is ticks/pixel.
#
# 'global-seq-feature' specifies if the key, scale, and background pattern are
# are applied to all patterns, or separately to each.  These values are stored
# in the MIDI file in the global SeqSpec (if true) or in each track.
#
# 'progress-bar-thick specifies a thicker progress bar.  Default is 1 pixel;
# thick is 2 pixels if set to true. Also makes the progress box border
# border 2 pixels, and the slot font bold.
#
# 'inverse-colors' (option -K/--inverse) specifies use of an inverse color
# palette. Palettes are for Seq66 drawing areas, not for Qt widgets.
# Normal/inverse palettes can be reconfigured via a 'palette' file.
#
# 'dark-theme' specifies that are dark theme is active.
#
# 'window-redraw-rate' specifies the base window redraw rate for all windows.
# From 10 to 100; default = 40 ms (25 ms for Windows).
#
# Window-scale (option '-o scale=m.n[xp.q]') specifies scaling the main
# window at startup. Defaults to 1.0 x 1.0. If between 0.5 and 3.0, it
# changes the size of the main window proportionately.

# 'convert-to-smf-1' controls if SMF 0 files are split into SMF 1 when read.
# 'buss-override' sets the output port for all patterns, for testing etc.

#
# 'velocity-override' when adding notes in the pattern editor is set via the
# 'Vol' button.  -1 ('Free'), preserves incoming velocity.
#
# 'bpm-precision' (spinner and MIDI control) is 0, 1, or 2.
# 'bpm-step-increment' affects the spinner and MIDI control. For 1 decimal,
# 0.1 is good. For 2, 0.01 is good, 0.05 is faster. Set 'bpm-page-increment'
# larger than the step-increment; used with the Page-Up/Page-Down keys in the
# spinner. BPM minimum/maximum sets the range in tempo graphing; defaults to
0.0 to 127.0. Decrease it for a magnified view of tempo.

# [user-options]

# key-height specifies the initial height (before vertical zoom) of pattern

#
# key-view specifies the default for showing labels for each key:
# 'octave-letters' (default), 'even_letters', 'all-letters',
# 'even-numbers', and 'all-numbers'.
#
# note-resume causes notes-in-progress to resume when the pattern toggles on.
#
# If specified, a style-sheet (e.g. 'qseq66.qss') is applied at startup.
# Normally just a base-name, it can contain a file-path to provide a style
# usable in many other applications.
#
# A fingerprint is a condensation of note events in a long track, to reduce
# the time drawing the pattern in the buttons. Ranges from 32 (default) to
# 128. 0 = don't use a fingerprint.
#
# progress-box width and height settings change the scaled size of the
# progress box in the live-loop grid buttons.  Width ranges from 0.50 to 1.0;
# the height from 0.10 to 0.50.  If either is 0, then the box isn't drawn.
# If either is 'default', defaults are used.
#
# progress-note-min and progress-note-max set the progress-box note range so
# that notes aren't centered in the box, but shown at their position by pitch.
#
# lock-main-window prevents the accidental change of size of the main
# window.

# [user-session]
