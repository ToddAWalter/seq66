# This file holds the main configuration for Seq66. It no longer follows the
# format of the seq24rc configuration file.
#
# 'version' is set by Seq66; it is used to detect older configuration files,
# which are upgraded to the new version when saved.
#
# 'verbose' just indicates the status of --verbose at exit.
#
# 'sets-mode' affects set muting when moving to the next set. 'normal' leaves
# the next set muted. 'auto-arm' unmutes it. 'additive' keeps the previous set
# armed when moving to the next set. 'all-sets' arms all sets at once.
#
# 'port-naming' is 'short' or 'long'. If short, the name shown in the port
# dialogs leaves off port numbering.

[comments]

This file and it's included configurations are meant for a test of the following
usage patterns:
 
    4x4 patterns
    Port mapping
    Added automation controls
 
For this test configuration, we move the "Loop" keystrokes for patterns 16 to 31
to other automation functions.  The "Mute" keystrokes (i.e. the shifted keys)
remain the same.
 
To enable this configuration first run the following command (Linux):
 
    $ qseq66 --home ~/.config/seq66/4x4
 
Once the 4x4 directory exists, copy the test configuration:
 
    $ cp contrib/tests/4x4/* ~/.config/seq66/4x4
 
An alternative is to do the test in place by copying the "session.rc" file to
~/.config/seq66 and point the "4x4" config variable to the full-path to
contrib/tests/4x4.  Then run "qseq66 --inspect 4x4".
 
Let the testing begin!

# Provides a flag and file-name for MIDI-control I/O settings. '""' means

# Provides a flag and play-list file. If no list, use '""' and set active
# = false. Use the extension '.playlist'. Even if not active, the play-list
# file is read. 'base-directory' sets the directory holding all MIDI files
# in all play-lists, useful when copying play-lists/tunes from one place to
# another; it preserves sub-directories (e.g. in creating an NSM session).

# Defines features of MIDI meta-event handling. Tempo events occur in the first

# Set this to have Seq66 create virtual ALSA/JACK I/O ports and not auto-connect

#   2 = MIDI Clock Modulo.
#
# With Clock Modulo, clocking doesn't begin until song position reaches the
# start-modulo value [midi-clock-mod-ticks]. One can disable a port manually
# for devices that are present, but not available (because another application,
