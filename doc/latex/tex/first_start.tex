\section{Let's Go!}
\label{sec:introduction_lets_go}

   \textsl{Seq66} requires ALSA or JACK on Linux;
   it does not support
   \index{pipewire}
   Pipewire.
   It might work with a Pipewire-JACK setup, but that usage has not been
   tested.
   On Windows, \textsl{Seq66} uses the MultiMedia API.
   This manual assumes that one is running \textsl{Seq66} on Linux, for the most
   part.

   For the first run, make sure all desired MIDI devices are plugged in and
   that all desired software synthesizers are running.
   Only ports present at startup will appear; this version of
   \textsl{Seq66} does not
   really support automatic detection of port changes at run-time.
   Start \textsl{Seq66}, verify that it comes up, and then exit it
   immediately.
   This first start creates the configuration files in
   \texttt{/home/user/.config/seq66/} (Linux) or
   \texttt{C:/Users/your\_user\_name/AppData/Local/seq66} (Windows).
   The main configuration file is
   \texttt{qseq66.rc} (Linux) or
   \texttt{qpseq66.rc} (Windows).

   Now start \textsl{Seq66} to use JACK or ALSA for MIDI.
   For USB MIDI devices on JACK, the \texttt{a2jmidid} program must be running
   (see \sectionref{sec:jack}, for details.)
   On \textsl{Windows}, just run it \texttt{qpseq66.exe};
   see \sectionref{sec:windows}.

   For better trouble-shooting, run it from the command-line at first and
   provide a MIDI file.
   The port settings will depend on your system.
   On our system, the synthesizer (\textsl{Yoshimi}) comes up on MIDI buss 5.
   (On \textsl{Windows}, buss 0 is the "MIDI Mapper", while buss 1 is the
   built-in wavetable synthesizer, which is normally under control of buss 0.)
   The \texttt{-{}-buss} option remaps all events to the desired buss:

   \begin{verbatim}
      $ qseq66 --alsa --buss 5 /usr/share/seq66/midi/b4uacuse-gm-patchless.midi
      $ qseq66 --jack --buss 5 /usr/share/seq66/midi/b4uacuse-gm-patchless.midi
   \end{verbatim}

   The buss-override setting can also be made via the port drop-down control
   in the main window. It will modify the MIDI file.
   The "data" directory is a directory created upon installation of the
   application:

   \begin{verbatim}
      /usr/share/seq66-0.90/                          (Linux)
      C:/Program Files (x86)/Seq66/data/              (Windows)
   \end{verbatim}

   It sample MIDI files and configuration files.
   Some of the files in those directories apply to both operating systems, so
   be sure to look at them.
   The user configration files are stored in the user's "home" area:

   \begin{verbatim}
      /home/user/.config/seq66/qseq66.*               (Linux)
      C:/Users/username/AppData/Local/seq66           (Windows)
   \end{verbatim}

   The configuration files in the "home" directory
   are created after the first run of \textsl{Seq66}.
   If all is well, the "play" button will start playback and the tune sounds.
   If not, look into \textbf{Edit / Preferences} or the configuration files.
   Don't change the configuration files while \textsl{Seq66} is running, as
   they are generally re-saved at application exit.
