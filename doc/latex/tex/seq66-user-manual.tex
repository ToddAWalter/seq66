\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

   This document describes "Seq66", a reboot of \textsl{Seq24} and a rewrite of
   \textsl{Sequencer64}, through version 0.98.4.
   The following project supports \textsl{Seq66} and documentation:

   \begin{itemize}
      \item \url{https://github.com/ahlstromcj/seq66.git}
   \end{itemize}

   Feel free to clone or fork it!

\subsection{Seq66: What!?}
\label{subsec:what_is_seq66}

   \textsl{Seq66} is \textsl{Sequencer64},
   a reboot of \textsl{Seq24},
   a live-looping sequencer with an interface similar to a hardware sequencer,
   refactored for newer versions of
   \textsl{C++} with cruft cleanup.  It drops the
   \textsl{Gtkmm} user-interface in favor of \textsl{Qt 5},
   and has better handling of sets, mute-groups, sessions, configuration files,
   play-lists, and automation control.
   It supports the \textsl{Non Session Manager},
   modifying the color palette, and Qt style-sheets.
   Be prepared to note some significant differences
   between \textsl{Seq66} and \textsl{Sequencer64}.

   \textsl{Seq66} is not a synthesizer.  It requires a hardware
   synthesizer or a software synthesizer.  It does not handle audio data,
   just MIDI.  It works with \textsl{ALSA}, \textsl{JACK},
   \textsl{PortMidi}, and \textsl{Windows}. It uses close-to-the-latest C++
   features for faster and simpler code.

   We have many contributors to acknowledge.
   Please see \sectionref{sec:kudos}.
   It is out-of-date!  If your name is not there, ping us!

\subsection{Seq66: Why!?}
\label{subsec:introduction_vs_others}

   The first reason to refactor \textsl{Sequencer64} is to take advantage of
   things learned in responding to user reports.  The second reason is to use
   the new code as an opportunity to add new functionality such as
   \textsl{Non Session Manager} support.  The third reason is to tighten the
   code by using newer features of \textsl{C++11} and later.
   The fourth reason is to make the innumerable minor improvements that come to
   attention with time and more testing.

\subsection{Improvements}
\label{subsec:improvements}

   The following improvements are some that have been made in
   \textsl{Seq66} versus \textsl{Sequencer64}.

   \begin{itemize}
      \item Qt 5 as the standard user-interface, with
         a better live frame using Qt push-buttons.
         Changing the main window's size works well.
      \item A song editor tab for laying out patterns into a complete
         performance. Includes transposable triggers. Also can be
         opened in its own window.
      \item A mutes editor tab, improvements to mutes handling, control, and
         status display.
      \item A playlist editor tab, with improved flexibility and automation.
      \item A sets editor tab.
      \item A events editor tab for basic fixing of minor event issues.
      \item A session tab (and Edit / Preference pages) for making sure that
         \textsl{Seq66} is running in the desired environment and configuation.
      \item Non Session Manager support. A sessions tab which shows the current
         locations of configuration files for the run.
      \item Repartitioning of the configuration files into separate files for
         flexibility; added a color palette file, Qt style-sheets; a beefed-up
         'ctrl' file.
      \item Improved alternate keyboard layout support.
      \item Mapping of port names to a consistent set of port numbers.
      \item Ability to export songs in SMF 0 format.
      \item Palette files and Qt style-sheets can reconfigure the colors
         of the painted text, lines, patterns, and the size and color of
         the user-interface items.
%        Qt style-sheets can be useful in tweaking items, such as text in
%        disabled controls that is difficult to see.
      \item More efficient lookups for controls using control maps
         and lambda functions.
   \end{itemize}

   For developers, a \textsl{Seq66} build is customizable via C macros,
   by enabling/disabling options at 'configure' time, and by many
   command-line arguments.  We cannot show all permutations of settings in this
   document, so don't be surprised if some screenshots don't quite match
   one's setup.
   Distro maintainers may create their own build configurations.

\subsection{Document Structure}
\label{subsec:introduction_document_structure}

   The structure of this document follows the user-interface of
   \textsl{Seq66}.
   To help the reader jump around this document, it provides
   multiple links, references, and index entries.

\subsection{Building Seq66}
\label{subsec:introduction_building_seq66}

   There are a number of ways of building Seq66.

   \begin{itemize}
      \item Autotools Build and Install. Configure, make, and install.
      \item Bootstrap Install. Generate autotools files and build.
      \item OpenSUSE Tumbleweed. Specifics for that Linux distro.
      \item Qmake-based Install. Optional on Linux, mandatory for Windows.
      \item Windows Installer.  Currently in the sequencer64-packages site on
         GitHub.
   \end{itemize}

   The \texttt{INSTALL} file included with the source code and
   documentation goes into great detail about these methods.
   Also see \texttt{data/readme.windows} and \texttt{contrib/notes/git.txt}
   for supplemental information.

\subsection{Let's Go!}
\label{subsec:introduction_lets_go}

   Make sure no other sound application is running, for the first run.
   Start \textsl{Seq66} to use JACK for MIDI, or
   on \textsl{Windows}, just run it (\texttt{qseq66}, or \texttt{qpseq66.exe}
   on \textsl{Windows}); for better trouble-shooting, run it from
   the command-line at first.
   The port settings will depend on your system.
   Provide a MIDI file.
   On our system, the synthesizer (\textsl{Yoshimi}) comes up on MIDI buss 5;
   on \textsl{Windows}, buss 0 is the "MIDI Mapper", while buss 1 is the
   built-in wavetable synthesizer, which is normally under control of buss 0.
   The \texttt{-{}-buss} option remaps all events to the desired buss:

   \begin{verbatim}
      $ qseq66 --jack-midi --buss 5 data/midi/b4uacuse-gm-patchless.midi
      C:\> qpseq66 --buss 1  data/midi/b4uacuse-gm-patchless.midi
   \end{verbatim}

   If the \texttt{-{}-alsa} option is used instead of
   \texttt{-{}-jack-midi}, then the \textsl{ALSA} subsystem is used
   (Linux only).
   The buss setting can also be made via the port drop-down control
   in the main window.

   The "data" directory is a directory created upon installation of the
   application:

   \begin{verbatim}
      /usr/share/seq66-0.90/                       (Linux)
      C:/Program Files (x86)/Seq66/data            (Windows)
   \end{verbatim}

   Some of the files in those directories apply to both operating systems, so
   be sure to poke around and look.
   The configration files are stored in the user's "home" area:

   \begin{verbatim}
      /home/user/.config/seq66/qseq66.*            (Linux)
      C:/Users/user/AppData/Local/seq66/qpseq66.*  (Windows)
   \end{verbatim}

   The configuration files in the "home" directory
   are created after the first run of \textsl{Seq66}.

   For our walk-through of the main window, the following figure
   shows it using green labels and borders for reference.

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering 
   \includegraphics[scale=0.65]{main-window/main-window-light-gridstyle-3-markup.png}
   \caption{Seq66 Main Screen}
   \label{fig:main_screen}
\end{figure}

   The \textsl{Seq66} main window appears as shown above.
   This figure has many differences from the \textsl{Seq24} main window,
   but the functionality is similar.
   \textsl{Seq66} behaves better on resizing, and can also
   be configured to start with its size scaled up or scaled down.
   Most features, including the "look" of the application,
   can be configured via the 'rc', 'usr', 'ctrl', 'drums', 'playlist', 'mutes',
   and 'palette' configuration files, via command-line options, via
   desktop themes, and via Qt style-sheets ('qss' files).
%  There are many new front-panel items in \textsl{Seq66}.
%  Many of these buttons have configurable keystrokes and configurable MIDI
%  controls.

   We break the discussion into sections for the following
   groups shown in the figure above:

   \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Tabs}
      \item \textbf{Main Screen Controls}
      \item \textbf{Menu}
   \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Tabs}
\label{subsubsec:introduction_main_tabs}

   The following tabs are present in \textsl{Seq66}:

   \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Live}
      \item \textbf{Song}
      \item \textbf{Editor}
      \item \textbf{Events}
      \item \textbf{Playlists}
      \item \textbf{Sets}
      \item \textbf{Mutes}
      \item \textbf{Session}
   \end{itemize}

   We present brief descriptions here and links to sections with more detail.
   All tabs are discussed in more detail, each in its own section.

\paragraph{Tabs / Live}
\label{paragraph:introduction_main_tabs_live}

   The \textbf{Live} tab is foremost in the application.
   It provides a grid of \textsl{patterns}
   (also called \textsl{loops}, \textsl{tracks}, or
   \textsl{sequences}) that display recorded MIDI data, status information, and
   provide popup-menus for each pattern.
   The buttons can
   be colored via a palette, and the status of being armed is easy to see
   from the theme's coloring of activated buttons, and a label that says "Armed"
   versus "Muted".
   In addition, the buttons can be toggled by a keystroke, shown in the lower
   right corner of the button.
   Another name for the \textbf{Live} tab is the \textbf{Patterns Panel};
   it can be replicated in multiple external windows.
   See \sectionref{sec:patterns_panel}.

\paragraph{Tabs / Song}
\label{paragraph:introduction_main_tabs_song}

   The \textbf{Song Editor} combines all patterns
   into a complete tune with controlled repetitions of each pattern.
   It provides a way to lay out \textsl{triggers} for each pattern
   that control playback without musician interaction.
   The editing capabilities of the song editor are extensive, including
   dragging triggers, addition transposition to triggers, and more.
   See \sectionref{sec:song_editor}.

\paragraph{Tabs / Editor}
\label{paragraph:introduction_main_tabs_editor}

   The \textbf{Pattern Editor} can be shown in the \textbf{Editor} tab or in an
   external window.  When opened in the tab, the pattern editor is compressed
   vertically by reducing the height of the "data" area and removing some
   buttons.  Otherwise, the pattern editor works the same in the tab and in
   external windows.
   See \sectionref{sec:pattern_editor}.

\paragraph{Tabs / Events}
\label{paragraph:introduction_main_tabs_events}

   The \textbf{Event Editor} provides a way to see the details of events
   and to do some modifying of them.
   It's meant for light usage; there are some less-used events that it cannot
   edit.
   It is especially useful in trouble-shooting.
   See \sectionref{sec:event_editor}.

\paragraph{Tabs / Playlist}
\label{paragraph:introduction_main_tabs_playlist}

   The \textbf{Playlist Editor} is meant for the creation of
   play-lists.  One can create multiple playlists with multiple songs in each
   playlist.  The selection of playlists and songs can be done via keystrokes
   or MIDI control.

   Note that editing of the playlists can also be done by directly editing a
   \texttt{.playlist} file.

   See \sectionref{sec:playlist}.

\paragraph{Tabs / Sets}
\label{paragraph:introduction_main_tabs_sets}

   The \textbf{Sets Editor} allows one to see, edit, and rearrange the sets
   that a tune contains.  Sets are also referred to as "banks".
   A useful feature of sets is that they can selected and cause a major change
   in the patterns that are playing.
   See \sectionref{sec:setmaster}.

\paragraph{Tabs / Mutes}
\label{paragraph:introduction_main_tabs_mutes}

   Mute-groups provide a way to turn on and turn off multiple patterns at once
   via a keystroke or a MIDI control; the \textbf{Mutes Editor} also provides a
   way to use buttons to control the mute-group.
   Mute-groups can be saved in the
   \texttt{.mutes} file or, optionally, in the tune itself.
   See \sectionref{sec:mutes_master}.

\paragraph{Tabs / Session}
\label{paragraph:introduction_main_tabs_session}

   The \textbf{Session} tab simply display some aspects of the running setup of
   \textsl{Seq66}.  It displays the name of the session manager, if any, client
   IDs, etc.  It also has a button reload the whole session after configuration
   changes are made.  It will eventually also contain a log of events, similar
   to the messages written to the terminal when \textsl{Seq66} is run from a
   terminal shell.
   Also see \sectionref{sec:sessions}.

\subsubsection{Main Top Controls (Condensed View)}
\label{subsubsec:introduction_main_top_controls}

   Here, we first discuss the top and bottom \textbf{Main} controls, as
   shown in the following collapsed figure:

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering 
   \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{main-window/main-window-controls.png}
   \caption{Main Screen Controls}
   \label{fig:main_screen_controls}
\end{figure}

   See the following section and
   \sectionref{subsubsec:introduction_main_bottom_controls}.

   The top panel of the Pattern window is simple, consisting of the
   name of the program and a few controls.
   The top main control items are, from left to right:

   \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{PPQN Selection}
      \item \textbf{Buss Override for Play-set}
      \item \textbf{Global Beats Per Measure}
      \item \textbf{Global Beat Width}
      \item \textbf{BBT or HMS Time Display}
      \item \textbf{Beat Indicator}
   \end{itemize}

   Not shown are some status indicators that can appear to the right of the
   "Seq66" logo:

   \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{ALSA} appears if running using ALSA for MIDI.
      \item \textbf{JACK} appears if running using JACK for MIDI.
      \item \textbf{Master} appears if running using JACK transport, as
         transport master.
         JACK transport can be used even if using ALSA for MIDI.
      \item \textbf{Slave} appears if using JACK transport as transport slave.
      \item \textbf{Portmidi} appears if using the internal portmidi-derived
         MIDI engine.  This is currently always the case on \textsl{Windows}.
   \end{itemize}

% Use this?
%  \setcounter{ItemCount}{0}
%  \itempar(PPQN Selection}{PPQN!selection}

\paragraph{PPQN Selection}
\label{paragraph:introduction_ppqn_selection}

   This drop-down allows one to change the pulses-per-quarter-note (PPQN) of the
   loaded tune, and this change can then be saved, if desired, with the file.
   As with \textsl{Seq24}, the default PPQN is 192.  This can be changed to
   to other values:
   \texttt{32, 48, 96, 192, 240, 384, 768, 960, 1920, 2400, 3840,
   7680, 9600, and 19200}.
   Values, even weird ones, can be entered by typing them.
   If a MIDI file is loaded, this modifies that file, rescaling all the
   pattern events and pattern triggers.
   Also see \sectionref{paragraph:menu_edit_preferences_play_options}.

\paragraph{Buss Override for Play-set}
\label{paragraph:introduction_sets_buss_override}

   This drop-down allows for overriding the buss (port) number used by all of
   the patterns in the current play-set.
   Unlike the \texttt{buss-override} setting in the 'usr' file
   (see \sectionref{subsubsec:usr_file_user_midi_settings}),
   this action causes a modification of the file (and a prompt to save at
   exit).

   \index{play-set}
   The \textsl{play-set} is the current set of patterns to be played.
   Normally, this set holds only the active patterns in the current
   play-screen.
   However, it can also be configured to include patterns from other sets.
   (See \sectionref{subsec:configuration_rc}.)

   The list of
   output busses is either the existing MIDI ports on the system, or,
   if port-mapping (see \sectionref{sec:port_mapping}) is active, the list
   of mapped output ports.
   Port-mapping is a useful way to redirect the set to a different output
   device; it can be used to provide a full set of virtual devices that any of
   the user's sequences can depend on.

   \index{--bus option}
   Another way to specify busses is the
   \texttt{-{}-buss n} command-line option.
   It causes \textsl{every} pattern in \textsl{every} set in the MIDI
   file to be directed to that buss number, and when a new
   sequence/pattern is created.  This option is only
   for convenience in testing.  Save the file, and it will
   have that buss number as part of each track's data, which makes the song
   file less portable, so be careful with both options.
   For portability, set the output buss to 0.

\paragraph{Global Beats Per Measure}
\label{paragraph:introduction_global_beats_per_measure}

   This drop-down changes the global beats/measure for the song.
   Along with the beat-width setting, this set of values allows
   for a large number of different time signatures, even crazy ones.

   Values: \texttt{1 to 16, 32}

\paragraph{Global Beat Width}
\label{paragraph:introduction_global_beat_width}

   This drop-down changes the global beat width (time-signature denominator)
   for the song.
   Along with the beats-per-measure setting, this set of values allows
   for a large number of different time signatures.

   Values: \texttt{1 to 16, 32}

\paragraph{BBT or HMS Time Display}
\label{paragraph:introduction_time_display}

   This text simply shows the current time during playback. 
   It can be shown in BBT (bars:beats:ticks) or HMS (hours:minutes:seconds)
   by clicking the \textbf{BBT/HMS} at the bottom of the window.

\paragraph{Beat Indicator}
\label{paragraph:introduction_beat_indicator}

   The beat indicator is inspired by the \textsl{Kepler34} implementation.
   It shows the first beat in color, and the rest of the beats in white.
   It does not adapt to changes in the time-signature until
   playback is stopped.

\subsubsection{Main Bottom Controls, First Row}
\label{subsubsec:introduction_main_bottom_controls}

   The bottom main control items take up two rows.
   The first row contains:

   \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Set Name}
      \item \textbf{Set Reset ("!")}
      \item \textbf{Active Set Indicator}
      \item \textbf{Set 0}
      \item \textbf{Set Changer}
   \end{itemize}

\paragraph{Set Name}
\label{paragraph:introduction_set_name}

   This text field shows the name of the current set, and also allows editing
   the set name.

\paragraph{Set Reset ("!")}
\label{paragraph:introduction_set_reset}

   This small button with an exclamation point
   to the right of the set name is meant to clear
   out all playing sets, and make only the current set the playing set.
   This button is useful when in "all-sets" mode or when sets get added
   automatically via the "additive" mode, so that multiple sets are playing
   at once.
   See \sectionref{subsec:configuration_rc}.

\begin{comment}

% The Set Master button has been removed.

\paragraph{Set Master Button}
\label{paragraph:introduction_set_master_button}

   This button brings up an external window showing the \textbf{Set Master}
   panel.  This panel is also available in a center tab.  It is a work in
   progress, and doesn't have a whole lot of functionality yet.
   It can currently show existing sets in one view, and allow
   reordering the sets.

\end{comment}

\paragraph{Active Set Indicator}
\label{paragraph:introduction_active_set_indicator}

   This read-only text field shows the set number of the currently active set.
   One can open a number of external \textsl{Live Frames} by
   Shift-left-clicking on pattern slots.  The currently active set is then the
   set that has the mouse focus.  This allows for working with multiple sets
   without a lot of mouse/keyboard navigation.

\paragraph{Set 0}
\label{paragraph:introduction_set_zero}

   This button provides a fast way to get back to set 0, without clicking the
   mouse a bunch of times.
   It is useful when creating an external live grid
   (see \sectionref{fig:multiple_live_grids}),
   which currently also sets the main grid to the same set.
   Click on this button, and the external set and set 0 can be seen at the same
   time.

\paragraph{Set Changer}
\label{paragraph:introduction_set_changer}

   This spin-box allows showing a different set in the main windows.
   This set can be modified by adding new patterns, changing its name, or
   importing other MIDI files into the current set.

\subsubsection{Main Bottom Controls, Second Row}
\label{subsubsec:introduction_main_bottom_controls_2}

   On to the next section of the main bottom buttons, the second row contains:

   \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Panic Button}
      \item \textbf{Stop Button}
      \item \textbf{Pause Button}
      \item \textbf{Play Button}
      \item \textbf{Loop Button} (not shown, new since 0.93.0)
      \item \textbf{Live Record}
      \item \textbf{Keep Queue Button}
      \item \textbf{Mute Group Learn Button}
      \item \textbf{Developer Test Button}
      \item \textbf{Song Editor Button}
      \item \textbf{Song Mode Button}
      \item \textbf{PPQN Indicator}
      \item \textbf{BBT/HMS Toggle Button}
      \item \textbf{Tap BPM Button}
      \item \textbf{Beats Per Minute Control}
   \end{itemize}

   Many of these controls have keystrokes and MIDI-control slots that can be
   set up in the 'ctrl' file.

\paragraph{Panic Button}
\label{paragraph:introduction_panic_button}

   This button causes playback to stop, all patterns to mute, and flushes the
   MIDI buss.
   There is a keystroke control and a MIDI control
   for this automation operation, plus
   a MIDI-announcement (output) configuration item for it.

\paragraph{Stop Button}
\label{paragraph:introduction_stop_button}

   This button stops playback and rewinds to the beginning of the song.
   By default, the \texttt{Esc} key operates this function,
   and there is both a MIDI-control slot and a MIDI-announcement slot
   available for it.

\paragraph{Pause Button}
\label{paragraph:introduction_pause_button}

   This button stops playback, but does not rewind to the beginning of the song.
   It also resumes playback at the same point as the pause.
   By default, the \texttt{Period} key operates this function,
   and there is a MIDI-control slot and a MIDI-announcement slot available for it.
   This key is also hardwired to pause and start playback in the pattern editor and
   the song editor.

\paragraph{Play Button}
\label{paragraph:introduction_play_button}

   This button starts playback, either at the beginning or at the pause point.
   Also called the "start button".
   By default, the \texttt{Space} key operates this function,
   and there is both a MIDI-control slot and a MIDI-announcement slot
   available for it.
   This key is also hardwired to toggle playback in the pattern editor and the
   song editor.

\paragraph{Loop Button}
\label{paragraph:introduction_loop_button}

   This button has been added to the main window as of version 0.93.0 of
   \textsl{Seq66}.
   This reflects that the \textbf{L/R} loop markers in the song editor can now
   be used in the pattern editor as well.  This new feature makes it easier to
   focus in on a pattern and tinker repeatedly with the same small section.
   In addition, looping can now be done in both the Live and Song modes of
   playback.

\paragraph{Live Record Button}
\label{paragraph:introduction_live_record_button}

   This button causes a live playing session to be recorded.
   That is, triggers are added to the song automatically as the musician mutes
   and unmutes patterns, and the triggers can then be
   seen as layouts in the \textsl{Song} editor.
   By default, the \texttt{P} key operates this function,

\paragraph{Keep Queue Button}
\label{paragraph:introduction_keep_queue_button}

   Puts the application into a "sticky" queue mode.
   In this mode, pressing a pattern key does not do a mute/unmute function, but
   instead turns on queuing for the selected pattern.
   By default, the \texttt{Backslash} key operates this function,
   and there is a MIDI-control slot available for it.

\paragraph{Mute Group Learn Button}
\label{paragraph:introduction_mute_group_learn_button}

   Also called the "L" button.
   Sets up to learn the current set of active patterns ("mute group") into a
   mute-group.
   When in group-learn mode, the \texttt{Shift} key cannot be hit, so the
   group-learn mode automatically converts the keys to their shifted versions.
   This feature known as \textsl{shift-lock} or \textsl{auto-shift}.
   After pressing the "L" button, the user can then press a keystroke, which is
   automatically shifted, and the pattern set is saved, and can be recalled by
   that button (shifted) later.  It can be saved in a 'mutes' file, as part of
   the MIDI tune, or in both places.

   \textsl{Example}:
   We have 5 patterns armed in the current set. Press the "L" button,
   and then press the "s" key.  These pattern statuses are saved and can be
   recalled later by the "S" ("s"-shifted) key.

   By default, the \texttt{el} (lower-case "l") key also sets this function,
   and there is a MIDI-control slot available for it, as well as a
   MIDI-announcement slot.
   In addition to that, one can also press
   the \texttt{Ctrl-L} key.
   The "el" with it!

   Remember that groups work with the playing ("in-view") screen-set.
   One must change the screenset and give it the command to make it the
   playing one.
   \index{keys!Home}
   By default, the \texttt{Home} key is configured for this purpose.

   There is also a setting in the 'mutes' file called
   \texttt{mute-group-selected}.  If this value is set to a value from 0 to 31,
   then that mute group will be automatically applied when
   \textsl{Seq66} starts up.
   This is useful with the loading of the most-recent MIDI file (which is also
   a feature of \textsl{Seq66}.

   Also see \sectionref{sec:mutes_master}.

\paragraph{Developer Test Button}
\label{paragraph:introduction_developer_test_button}

   This button is always disabled.  Functionality is added temporarily when
   testing new features. Ignore this button.

\paragraph{Song Editor Button}
\label{paragraph:introduction_song_editor_button}

   This button (with a "pencil" icon)
   brings up an external window for editing the Song/Performance
   information.  If already up, it closes it.  Works the same as the
   \textbf{Edit / Song Editor} menu or the hard-wired \texttt{Ctrl-E} key.

\paragraph{Live/Song Mode Button}
\label{paragraph:introduction_livesong_mode_button}

   This button toggles between the \textsl{Live} and \textsl{Song} performance
   mode. In the Live mode, the musician controls are muting/unmuting of each
   pattern.  In the Song mode, the triggers layed out in the
   \textbf{Song Editor} control the playback.
   By default, the \texttt{F10} key operates this function,
   There is also a MIDI automation control for this button.

\begin{comment}
   \itempar{Toggle Tracks}{pattern!toggle tracks}
   \index{pattern!toggle tracks}
   This button changes the status of all of the
   \textsl{playing} tracks, reversing the
   mute status of each pattern that is playing.
   The next click will then unmute only those tracks.
   Because it can be confusing, this button is disabled (not shown
   in the figure) in Song mode.

   LATER:  Describe
   \texttt{Ctrl-M},
   \texttt{Ctrl-U}, and
   \texttt{Ctrl-T}.

\paragraph{PPQN Indicator}
\label{paragraph:introduction_ppqn_indicator}

   This read-only field displays the current PPQN for the current tune.

   \configref{usr}{user-midi-settings}{midi\_ppqn}

\paragraph{BBT/HMS Toggle Button}
\label{paragraph:introduction_time_format_toggle_button}

   Toggles the format of the current time displayed during playback. 
   It can be shown in B:B:T (bars:beats:ticks) or H:M:S (hours:minutes:seconds).

\paragraph{Tap BPM Button}
\label{paragraph:introduction_tap_bpm_button}

   Tap this button with a regular beat to determine the beats-per-minute of the
   tapping.  With each tap, the counter on the button increments and the BPM is
   recalculated.  Stop tapping for a few seconds to reset the counter.
   By default, the \texttt{F9} key operates this function, but it
   STILL NEEDS WORK to show the results in the BPM control.
   There is also a MIDI-control slot for this function.

\paragraph{Beats Per Minute Control}
\label{paragraph:introduction_bpm_control}

   This control can be text-edited or spun to change the beats/minute value
   used in playing back the current song.  This value is also saved to the
   file.

%     \item Log Tempo, which inserts the current tempo into the tempo track
%        as an event.
%     \item Tempo recording, which inserts all tempo changes as tempo events.
