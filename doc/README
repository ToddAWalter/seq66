Documentation Directory for Seq66 0.xx.0
Chris Ahlstrom
2021-04-17 to 2022-01-03

This directory used to contain documents to be installed in the
${prefix}/share/doc/seq66-0.xx directory (e.g. /usr/share/doc or
/usr/local/share/doc) on Linux, or in the installation ${install}/data
directory (e.g. C:/Program Files (x86)/Seq66/data)
on Windows.

These documents have been moved to the "data/share/doc" directory for
uniformity.

The documentation consists of a large PDF Seq66 User Manual and an Open
Document Format spreadsheet describing the configuration for the Novation
LaunchPad Mini supplied with Seq6.
