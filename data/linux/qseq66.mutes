# This file replaces the [mute-group] section, making it a little
# easier to manage multiple sets of mute groups.

# The [comments] section can document this file.  Lines starting
# with '#' and '[' are ignored.  Blank lines are ignored.  Show a
# blank line by adding a space character to the line.

[comments]

(Comments added to this section are preserved.  Lines starting with
 a '#' or '[', or that are blank, are ignored.  Start lines that must
 be blank with a space.)

# This file holds the mute-groups configuration for Seq66.
# It follows the format of the 'rc' configuration file, but is
# stored separately for convenience.  It is always stored in the
# main configuration directory.  To use this file, replace the
# [mute-group] section and its contents with a [mute-group-file]
# tag, and simply add the basename (e.g. nanomutes.mutes) on a
# separate line.
#
# save-mutes-to: 'both' writes the mutes value to both the mutes
# and the MIDI file; 'midi' writes only to the MIDI file; and
# and 'mutes' only to the mutesfile.
# 
# mute-group-rows and mute-group-columns: Specifies the size of the
# grid.  For now, keep these values at 4 and 8.
# 
# groups-format: 'bin' means to write the mutes as 0 or 1; 'hex' means
# to write them as hexadecimal numbers (e.g. 0xff), which will be
# useful with larger set sizes.

[mute-groups]

# All mute-group values are saved in this 'mutes' file, even if they
# all are zero; but if all are zero, they will be stripped out from
# the MIDI file by the strip-empty-mutes functionality. If a hex number
# is used, then each number represents a bit mask, rather than a single
# bit.
