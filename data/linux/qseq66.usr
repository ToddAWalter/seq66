# This is a seq66.usr file. Edit it and place it in the
# $HOME/.config/seq66 directory. It allows one to provide an
# alias (alternate name) to each MIDI bus, MIDI channel, and MIDI
# control codes per channel. It has additional options not present
# in Sequencer64, and also supports DOS INI variable setting.

# 1. Define your instruments and their control-code names,
#    if they have them.
# 2. Define a MIDI bus, its name, and what instruments are
#    on which channel.
#
# In the following MIDI buss definitions, channels are counted
# from 0 to 15, not 1 to 16.  Instruments not set here are set to
# -1 (SEQ66_GM_INSTRUMENT_FLAG) and are GM (General MIDI).
# These replacement MIDI buss labels are shown in MIDI Clocks,
# MIDI Inputs, and in the Pattern Editor buss drop-down.
#
# To temporarily disable the entries, set the count values to 0.

# ======== Seq66-Specific Variables Section ========

[user-interface-settings]

# These settings specify the modifiable configuration
# of some of the Seq66 user-interface elements.

# Specifies the style of the main-window pattern grid. The enum values
# are: normal (0), white (1), black (2), and button (3).
#
# GTK:
#   0 = Normal style, matches the GTK theme, has brackets.
#   1 = White grid boxes that have brackets.
#   2 = Black grid boxes (no brackets, our favorite).
#
# Qt:
#   0 = Slot coloring matches Kepler34; the whole slot is colored.
#   1 = Slot coloring more like GTK; color only the event box.
#   2 = Not used.
#   3 = Used for selecting the button grid instead of frame grid.

3       # grid_style

# Specifies the box style of an empty slot in the main-window
# grid, for the GTK user-interface only.
#
#  0 = Draw a one-pixel box outline around the pattern slot.
#  1 = Draw brackets on the sides of the pattern slot.
#  2 to 30 = Make the brackets thicker and thicker.
# -1 = Same as 0, draw a box outline one-pixel thick.
# -2 to -30 = Draw a box outline, thicker and thicker.

1       # grid_brackets

# Specifies the number of rows in the main window.
# Values of 4 (the default) through 8 (the best alternative value)
# are allowed. Same as R in the '-o sets=RxC' option.

4       # mainwnd_rows

# Specifies the number of columns in the main window.
# At present, values from 8 (the default) to 12 are supported.
# are allowed. Same as C in the '-o sets=RxC' option.

8       # mainwnd_cols

# Specifies the maximum number of sets, which defaults to 32. It is
# never necessary to change this value. It is based on set-size now.
# Do not change it. It is just informative.

32      # max_sets

# Specifies the border width in the main window.

0      # mainwid_border

# Specifies the border spacing in the main window. Normally 2, it
# can range from 2 to 16.

2      # mainwid_spacing

# Specifies a quantity that affects the height of the main window.

0      # control_height

# Specifies the initial zoom for the piano rolls.  Ranges from 1.
# to 512 (the legacy maximum was 32), and defaults to 2 unless
# changed here.  Note that large PPQN values will require larger
# zoom values in order to look good in the sequence editor.
# Seq66 adapts the zoom to the PPQN, if zoom is set to 0.

2      # default zoom (0 = auto-adjust to PPQN)

# Specifies if the key, scale, and background sequence are to be
# applied to all sequences, or to individual sequences.  The
# behavior of Seq24 was to apply them to all sequences.  But
# Seq66 takes it further by applying it immediately, and
# by saving to the end of the MIDI file.  Note that these three
# values are stored in the MIDI file, not this configuration file.
# Also note that reading MIDI files not created with this feature
# will pick up this feature if active, and the file gets saved.
# It is contagious.
#
# 0 = Allow each sequence to have its own key/scale/background.
#     Settings are saved with each sequence.
# 1 = Apply these settings globally (similar to seq66).
#     Settings are saved in the global final section of the file.

1      # global_seq_feature

# Specifies if the old, console-style font, or the new anti-
# aliased font, is to be used as the font throughout the GUI.
# In legacy mode, the old font is the default.
#
# 0 = Use the old-style font.
# 1 = Use the new-style font.

1      # use_new_font

# Specifies if the user-interface will support two song editor
# windows being shown at the same time.  This makes it easier to
# edit songs with a large number of sequences.
#
# 0 = Allow only one song editor (performer editor).
# 1 = Allow two song editors.

1      # allow_two_perfedits

# Specifies the number of 4-measure blocks for horizontal page
# scrolling in the song editor.  The old default, 1, is a bit
# small.  The new default is 4.  The legal range is 1 to 6, where
# 6 is the width of the whole performer piano roll view.

4      # perf_h_page_increment

# Specifies the number of 1-track blocks for vertical page
# scrolling in the song editor.  The old default, 1, is a bit
# small.  The new default is 8.  The legal range is 1 to 18, where
# 18 is about the height of the whole performer piano roll view.

8      # perf_v_page_increment

# Specifies if the progress bar is colored black, or a different
# color.  The following integer color values are supported:
# 
# 0 = black
# 1 = dark red
# 2 = dark green
# 3 = dark orange
# 4 = dark blue
# 5 = dark magenta
# 6 = dark cyan

0      # progress_bar_colored

# Specifies if the progress bar is thicker.  The default is 1
# pixel.  The 'thick' value is 2 pixels.  (More than that is not
# useful.  Set this value to 1 to enable the feature, 0 to disable
# it.

1      # progress_bar_thick

# Specifies using an alternate (darker) color palette.  The
# default is the normal palette.  Not all items in the user
# interface are altered by this setting, and it's not perfect.
# Set this value to 1 to enable the feature, 0 to disable it.
# Same as the -K or --inverse command-line options.

0      # inverse_colors

# Specifies the window redraw rate for all windows that support
# that concept.  The default is 40 ms.  Some windows used 25 ms,
# which is faster.

40      # window_redraw_rate

# Specifies using icons for some of the user-interface buttons
# instead of text buttons.  This is purely a preference setting.
# If 0, text is used in some buttons (the main window buttons).
# Otherwise, icons are used.  One will have to experiment :-).

0      # use_more_icons (currently affects only main window)

# Specifies the number of set-window ('wid') rows to show.
# The long-standing default is 1, but 2 or 3 may also be set.
# Corresponds to R in the '-o wid=RxC,F' option.
# Support for this option is obsolete in Seq66.

1      # block_rows (number of rows of set blocks/wids)

# Specifies the number of set window ('wid') columns to show.
# The long-standing default is 1, but 2 may also be set.
# Corresponds to C in the '-o wid=RxC,F' option.
# Support for this option is obsolete in Seq66.

1      # block_columns (number of columns of set blocks/wids)

# Specifies if the multiple set windows are 'in sync' or can
# be set to arbitrary set numbers independently.
# The default is false (0), means that there is a single set
# spinner, which controls the set number of the upper-left 'wid',
# and the rest of the set numbers follow sequentially.  If true
# (1), then each 'wid' can be set to any set-number.
# Corresponds to the 'f' (true, false, or 'indep') in the
# '-o wid=RxC,F' option.  Here, 1 is the same as 'indep' or false,
# and 0 is the same as f = true.  Backwards, so be careful.
# Support for this option is obsolete in Seq66.

0      # block_independent (set spinners for each block/wid)

# Specifies an enlargement of the main window of Seq66.
# The normal value is 1.0, which is the legacy sizing.  If this
# value is between 0.5 and 3.0, it will change the size of the main
# window proportionately. Same as the '-o scale=m.n[xp.q]' option.

1 1      # window_scale (scales main window width and height)

[user-midi-ppqn]

# These settings replace the midi_ppqn setting below.  We need to
# separate the file-ppqn flag from the default PPQN that the user
# wants Seq66 to support.

default-ppqn = 960
use-file-ppqn = false

[user-midi-settings]

# These settings specify MIDI-specific value that might be
# better off as variables, rather than constants.

# Specifies parts-per-quarter note to use, if the MIDI file.
# does not override it.  Default is 192, but we'd like to go
# lower and higher than that. Set to 0 to use the PPQN from the
# MIDI files, rather than scaling its PPQN re midi_ppqn().

192       # midi_ppqn, --ppqn p

# Specifies the default beats per measure, or beats per bar.
# The default value is 4, the range is 1 to 20.

4       # midi_beats_per_measure/bar

# Specifies the default beats per minute.  The default value
# is 120, and the legal range is 20 to 600. Also see the value of
# midi_bpm_minimum and midi_bpm_maximum below.

120       # midi_beats_per_minute

# Specifies the default beat width. The default value is 4.

4       # midi_beat_width

# Specifies the buss-number override, the same as the --bus
# command-line option. The default value is -1, which means that
# there is no buss override.  If a value from 0 to 31 is given,
# then that buss value overrides all buss values in all patterns.
# Change this value from -1 only to use a single output buss,
# either for testing or convenience.  And don't save the MIDI file
# afterwards, unless you want to overwrite all the buss values!

-1       # midi_buss_override (disabled)

# Specifies the default velocity override when adding notes in the
# sequence/pattern editor.  This value is obtained via the 'Vol'
# button, and ranges from 0 (not recommended :-) to 127.  If the
# value is -1, then the incoming note velocity is preserved.

-1       # velocity_override (-1 = 'Free')

# Specifies the precision of the beats-per-minutes spinner and
# MIDI control over the BPM value.  The default is 0, which means
# the BPM is an integer.  Other values are 1 and 2 decimal digits
# of precision.

0       # bpm_precision

# Specifies the step increment of the beats/minute spinner and
# MIDI control over the BPM value.  The default is 1. For a
# precision of 1 decimal point, 0.1 is a good value.  For a
# precision of 2 decimal points, 0.01 is a good value, but one
# might want somethings a little faster, like 0.05.

1       # bpm_step_increment

# Specifies the page increment of the beats/minute field. It is
# used when the Page-Up/Page-Down keys are pressed while the BPM
# field has the keyboard focus.  The default value is 10.

10       # bpm_page_increment

# Specifies the minimum value of beats/minute in tempo graphing.
# By default, the tempo graph ranges from 0.0 to 127.0.
# This value can be increased to give a magnified view of tempo.

0       # midi_bpm_minimum

# Specifies the maximum value of beats/minute in tempo graphing.
# By default, the tempo graph ranges from 0.0 to 127.0.
# This value can be increased to give a magnified view of tempo.

127       # midi_bpm_maximum

[user-options]

# These settings specify application-specific values that are
# set via the -o or --option switch, which help expand the number
# of options the Seq66 options can support.

# The 'daemonize' option is used in seq66cli to indicate that the
# application should be gracefully run as a service.

0       # option_daemonize

# This value specifies an optional log-file that replaces output
# to standard output and standard error.  To indicate no log-file,
# the string "" is used.  Currently, this option works best from
# the command line, as in '-o log=filename.log'.  However, the
# name here is used only if the bare option '-o log' is specified.

""

[user-work-arounds]

# These settings specify application-specific values that work
# around issues that we have not been able to truly fix for all
# users.

# The work_around_play_image option can be set to 0 or 1.  0 is
# the normal setting. Set it to 1 if multiple-clicks of the play
# button (or the equivalent play/pause/stop actions) cause the
# seq66 application to crash.

0       # work_around_play_image

# The work_around_transpose_image option is similar, for an issue
# some users have setting the transpose button in seqedit.

0       # work_around_transpose_image

[user-ui-tweaks]

# This first value specifies the height of the keys in the
# sequence editor.  Defaults to 12 (pixels), but 8 is better.

10       # key_height

# Normally, the Qt version of Seq66 uses the old pattern editor in the
# 'Edit' tab.  If this value is set to 1, then the new, larger,
# more functional pattern editor can be used in the 'Edit' tab. This
# setting makes the whole Seq66 window larger.

1       # use_new_seqedit

# The note-resume option, if active, causes any notes in progress
# to be resumed when the pattern is toggled back on.

note-resume = false

[user-session]

# This section specifies the session manager to use, if any.  It
# contains only one variable, 'session', which can be set to 'none'
# (the default), 'nsm' (Non or New Session Manager), or 'lash' (the
# LASH session manager.  The 'url' variable can be set to the value
# of the NSM_URL environment variable set by nsmd when run outside
# of the Non Session Manager user-interface. Set the URL only if
# running nsmd standalone with a matching --osc-port number.

session = none
url = ""

[new-pattern-editor]

# This section contains the setup values for recording when a new
# pattern is opened. For flexibility, a new pattern means only that
# the loop has the default name, 'Unititled'. These values save time
# during a live recording session. Note that the valid values for
# record-style are 'merge', 'overwrite', and 'expand'.

armed = false
thru = false
record = false
qrecord = false
record-style = merge
