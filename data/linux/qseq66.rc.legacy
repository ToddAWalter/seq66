#
# This file holds the main configuration options for Seq66.
# It loosely follows the format of the seq24 'rc' configuration
# file, but adds some new options, and is no longer compatible.
# 
# The next section is only a marker to help better control configuration
# management.

# This new style of control stanza incorporates key control as well.
# The leftmost number on each line here is the pattern number (e.g.
# 0 to 31); the group number, same range, for up to 32 groups; or it
# it is an automation control number, again a similar range.
# This internal MIDI control number is followed by three groups of
# bracketed numbers, each providing three different type of control:
#
#    Normal:           [toggle]    [on]      [off]
#    Playback:         [pause]     [start]   [stop]
#    Playlist:         [by-value]  [next]    [previous] (if active)
#
# In each group, there are six numbers:
#
#    [on/off invert status d0 d1min d1max]
#
# 'on/off' enables/disables (1/0) the MIDI control for the pattern.
# 'invert' (1/0) causes the opposite if data is outside the range.
# 'status' is by MIDI event to match (channel is NOT ignored).
# 'd0' is the first data value.  Example: if status is 144 (Note On),
# then d0 represents Note 0.
#
# 'd1min'/'d1max' are the range of second values that should match.
# Example:  For a Note On for note 0, 0 and 127 indicate that any
# Note On velocity will cause the MIDI control to take effect.

[mute-group-flags]

save-mutes-to-rc = preserve
mute-group-rows = 4
mute-group-columns = 8
write-legacy-mutes = false

[mute-groups]

# All mute-group values are saved in this 'mutes' file, even if they
# all are zero; but if all are zero, they will be stripped out from
# the MIDI file by the new strip-empty-mutes functionality (a build
# option).  This is less confusing to the user, who expects that
# section to be intact.


[midi-clock]

# The first line indicates the number of MIDI busses defined.
# Each buss line contains the buss (re 0) and the clock status of
# that buss.  0 = MIDI Clock is off; 1 = MIDI Clock on, and Song
# Position and MIDI Continue will be sent, if needed; 2 = MIDI
# Clock Modulo, where MIDI clocking will not begin until the song
# position reaches the start modulo value [midi-clock-mod-ticks].
# A value of -1 indicates that the output port is totally
# disabled.  One can set this value manually for devices that are
# present, but not available, perhaps because another application
# has exclusive access to the device (e.g. on Windows).

     # number of MIDI clocks (output busses)


[midi-clock-mod-ticks]

# The Song Position (in 16th notes) at which clocking will begin
# if the buss is set to MIDI Clock mod setting.

64

[midi-meta-events]

# This section defines some features of MIDI meta-event handling.
# Normally, tempo events are supposed to occur in the first track
# (pattern 0).  But one can move this track elsewhere to accomodate
# one's existing body of tunes.  If affects where tempo events are
# recorded.  The default value is 0, the maximum is 1023.
# A pattern must exist at this number for it to work.

0    # tempo_track_number

[midi-input]

    # number of input MIDI busses

# The first number is the port number, and the second number
# indicates whether it is disabled (0), or enabled (1).


# If set to 1, this option allows the master MIDI bus to record
# (filter) incoming MIDI data by channel, allocating each incoming
# MIDI event to the sequence that is set to that channel.
# This is an option adopted from the Seq32 project at GitHub.

0   # flag to record incoming data by channel

[manual-alsa-ports]

# Set to 1 to have seq66 create its own ALSA ports and not
# connect to other clients.  Use 1 to expose all 16 MIDI ports to
# JACK (e.g. via a2jmidid).  Use 0 to access the ALSA MIDI ports
# already running on one's computer, or to use the autoconnect
# feature (Seq66 connects to existing JACK ports on startup.

0   # flag for manual ALSA ports

[reveal-alsa-ports]

# Set to 1 to have seq66 ignore any system port names
# declared in the 'user' configuration file.  Use this option if
# you want to be able to see the port names as detected by ALSA.

0   # flag for reveal ALSA ports
# Set to 1 to allow Seq66 to stay in note-adding mode when
# the right-click is released while holding the Mod4 (Super or
# Windows) key.

0   # allow_mod4_mode

# Set to 1 to allow Seq66 to split performerance editor
# triggers at the closest snap position, instead of splitting the
# trigger exactly in its middle.  Remember that the split is
# activated by a middle click.

0   # allow_snap_split

# Set to 1 to allow a double-click on a slot to bring it up in
# the pattern editor.  This is the default.  Set it to 0 if
# it interferes with muting/unmuting a pattern.

1   # allow_click_edit

[jack-transport]

# jack_transport - Enable slave synchronization with JACK Transport.
# Also contains the new flag to use JACK MIDI.

0   # with_jack_transport

# jack_master - Seq66 attempts to serve as JACK Master.
# Also must enable jack_transport (the user interface forces this,
# and also disables jack_master_cond).

0   # with_jack_master

# jack_master_cond - Seq66 is JACK master if no other JACK
# master exists. Also must enable jack_transport (the user interface
# forces this, and disables jack_master).

0   # with_jack_master_cond

# song_start_mode (applies mainly if JACK is enabled).

# 0 = Playback in live mode. Allows muting and unmuting of loops.
#     from the main (patterns) window.  Disables both manual and
#     automatic muting and unmuting from the performerance window.
# 1 = Playback uses the song (performerance) editor's data and mute
#     controls, regardless of which window was used to start the
#     playback.

0   # song_start_mode

# jack_midi - Enable JACK MIDI, which is a separate option from
# JACK Transport.

0   # with_jack_midi

[auto-option-save]

# Set the following value to 0 to disable the automatic saving of the
# current configuration to the 'rc' and 'user' files.  Set it to 1 to
# follow seq24 behavior of saving the configuration at exit.
# Note that, if auto-save is set, many of the command-line settings,
# such as the JACK/ALSA settings, are then saved to the configuration,
# which can confuse one at first.  Also note that one currently needs
# this option set to 1 to save the configuration, as there is not a
# user-interface control for it at present.

1     # auto-save-options-on-exit support flag

[playlist]

# Provides a configured play-list and a flag to activate it.
