   <b>Main Automation Keystrokes</b>
      Some of the more important automation keystrokes are described here.
      The arrow-keys are hardwired in all panes; here they are used
      when the live grid has focus.
      For full details, see the user manual or the
      <code>.../share/doc/seq66-0.99/control_keys.ods</code>
      spreadsheet.
      The latter is more likely to be up-to-date.
