This directory contains additional MIDI files. Below we collect a few
notes of interest about some of them.

    judyblue.mid

        This file has a lot of zero-length notes. When loaded into Seq66,
        these are corrected (and a list is shown in debugging in a console
        window). Also, all of the note-offs are represented by note-ons
        with velocity 0. Cannot remember whether we used EditTrack or
        Cakewalk (for DOS or for Windows) to key this one in.
