This directory contains sample MIDI files to be installed for
instructional purposes.

    b4uacufm.mid
    b4uacuse-gm-patchless.midi

        The first file is our original transcription of the Eric Clapton &
        Robert Cray tune "Before You Accuse Me".  The second file is converted
        to Seq66 format, though each pattern is very long and only one trigger
        per pattern is used in the song editor.  It makes a good way to verify
        that the basics work.

    Chameleon-HHancock-Ov.midi

        We found this file, and it is a pleasant rendition of a Herbie Hancock
        classic.
    
    colours.midi

        This file illustrates the usage of colors in patterns.

    EE-qsynth-presets.conf

        This sample can be added to the QSynth configuration.  However, we
        have found that Timidity works better out of the box for previewing
        tunes.

    If_You_Could_Read_My_Mind.mid

        Another song found, used in our initial testing of the Windows build.

    Kraftwerk-Europe_Endless-reconstructed.midi
    Kraftwerk-Europe_Endless.asc
    Kraftwerk-Europe_Endless.text

        This MIDI file is a reconstruction of a MIDI file found on the Web.
        What we did with it is described in the "text" file.  The "asc" is a
        partial dump (via midicvt) of some of the events in the original file.
