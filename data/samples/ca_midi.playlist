# Seq66 0.91.0 (and above) playlist file
#
# /home/ahlstrom/.config/seq66/ca_midi.playlist
# Written on 2021-01-07 10:03:47
#
# This file holds multiple playlists for Seq66. It consists of one
# or more '[playlist]' sections.  Each section has a user-specified
# number, which serves for sorting and for MIDI control, ranging
# from 0 to 127, or higher if the user doesn't use MIDI control on
# playlist files.
#
# Next comes a display name for this list, with or without quotes.
#
# Next comes the name of the directory, always using the UNIX-style
# separator, a forward slash (solidus).  It can optionally be
# terminated with a slash.  It should be accessible from wherever
# Seq66 was run.
#
# The last items are lines starting with a MIDI control number,
# followed by the name of the MIDI file.  They are sorted by the
# control number, starting from 0.  They can be simple 'base.ext'
# file-names; the playlist directory will be prepended before the
# song is accessed. If the MIDI file-name already has a path, that
# directory will be used.
#
# The [comments] section can document this file.  Lines starting
# with '#' are ignored.  Blank lines are ignored.  Show a
# blank line by adding a space character to the line.

This playlist points to files on my Debian laptop.  I created these files
long, long ago.
Ah, such memories.
