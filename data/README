Data Directory for Seq66 0.97.1
Chris Ahlstrom
2018-01-02 to 2021-10-13

This directory contains files to be installed in the ${prefix}/share/seq66-0.97
directory ("prefix" is /usr/share or /usr/local/share) on Linux, or in the
installation ${install}/data directory (e.g. C:/Program Files (x86)/Seq66/data)
on Windows.

Seq66 will create the configuration directory and configuration file
the first time, but we also supply some samples.  The files include alternate
configuration files that the user can copy to

    $HOME/.config/seq66                   (Linux)
    C:/Users/YourName/AppData/Local/seq66 (Windows)

and modify to satisfaction, plus some sample Seq66 MIDI files, and MIDI
in/out control for the Novation Launchpad Mini.

Please note that the files in the "data/linux" directory can also be used
in Windows.  They are simply named for the Linux executable, "qseq66",
rather than the Windows executable "qpseq66.exe".
