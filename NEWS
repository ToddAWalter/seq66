2015-07-10 to 2021-06-09

This file collects major changes that are older and clutter up
the README file.  This file should be called "OLD NEWS".

    -   Version 0.92.2:
        -   Added a Qt "style-sheet" configuration it to the 'usr' file. It
            can be used to alter the appearance of the application beyond what
            a palette can do.  A sample 'qss' file is provided.
        -   Fixed PPQN modification, added user-interface and 'usr'
            configuration to change the default PPQN from 192.
        -   Fixed many issues with changing the time signature.
        -   Fixed creation of new configuration files.
        -   Fixed port-mapping for MIDI output, control, and status display.
        -   Removed the external set-master; use the set-master tab.
        -   Tightened meta-events and set-handling.
        -   More fixes to Song recording; added a Snap button for it.
        -   Fixed the rendering of the beat indicator and pattern fonts.
        -   Updated the man pages and the documentation.
    -   Version 0.92.1:
        -   Fixed issue #42 by adding scrollbars to I/O lists in Preferences
            when there are many ports on the system; also increased port
            limits to 48 ports.
        -   Fixed issues with iterating through MIDI events in the
            user-interfaces.
        -   Big fixes to Song recording. More to do?
        -   Added an experimental one-shot auto-step step-edit feature for
            recording (for example) drumbeats from MIDI devices.
        -   Fixed bug in parsing Fluidsynth port names.
        -   Improved handling of MIDI I/O control of Seq66.  Added more
            automation-display events, more testing.
        -   Updated documentation, including a ODF spreadsheet for the MIDI
            control configuration of the Launchpad Mini.
    -   Version 0.92.0:
        -   Fixed issue #34: "seq66 does not follow jack_transport tempo changes"
        -   Fixed issues with applying 'usr' buss and instrument names to the
            pattern-editor menus.
        -   Fixing serious issues with the event editor. Now deletes both
            linked notes.
        -   Added mute-group-out to show mutegroups on Launchpad Mini buttons.
        -   Tightened up mute-group handling, configuration file handling,
            play-list handling, and MIDI display device handling.
        -   Stream-line the format of the 'ctrl' file by removing columns for
            the values of "enabled" and "channel".  Will detect older formats
            and fix them.
        -   A PDF user manual is now provided in the doc directory, installed
            to /usr/local/share/doc/seq66-0.92 with "make install".
