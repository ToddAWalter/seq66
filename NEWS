Chris Ahlstrom
2015-07-10 to 2022-06-02

This file collects major changes that are older and clutter up
the README.md file.  This file should be called "OLD NEWS".

    -   Version 0.98.6:
        -   Revisited issue #41 to make sure "Quit" is "Hide" under NSM. Also
            fixed issue with the "newtune.midi" default name.
        -   Fixed a minor bug involving setting input aliases.
        -   Fixed bug with setting last-used-directory to "".
        -   Fixed handling of Live/Song mode in performer and in 'rc' saving.
        -   Fixed stupid seqedit bug for selecting beats/bar.
        -   Disabling/enabling JACK input and output on the fly in Preferences
            works, as long as they had been enabled at startup.
        -   Added Preferences options to toggle the double-click edit feature
            and select the Live/Song/Auto mode.  Added Apply/Reset buttons.
        -   Removed long-unused "rtmidi callback" code and other disabled code.
        -   Got user-manual screenshots up-to-date.
        -   Upgraded and fixed file-name splitting and rebuilding.
        -   Modify flag now set when painting notes in seqroll.
        -   Improved appearance of Loop/Record/Quantize buttons in main grid.
        -   Improved modification detection of sequences and main window.
        -   Refactored global SeqSpecs for better robustness, fewer surprises.
        -   Added a file-changed check before restarting the application.
        -   More code/macro cleanup.
    -   Version 0.98.5:
        -   Added locking for the event-drawing loops to prevent segfaults.
            Active only when recording; prevents iterator invalidation.
        -   Added an underrun indicator to the main window.
        -   The client name ("seq66") is no longer shown, nor saved in the 'rc'
            file. Easier to use multiple Seq66's with the --client-name option.
        -   Updating Dia diagram, finding and fixing issues and dead code.
        -   Added global internal check for both portmaps being active.
        -   Fixed bad slot connection for import_midi_into_session().
        -   Bad command-line options now cause an exit. This includes JACK
            options when Seq66 is built without JACK support.
        -   Improve the coherence of JACK-less builds. Some related NSM tweaks.
        -   Adding JACK access functions for the future. Improved internal
            port initialization code. Removed some non-useful rtmidi code.
        -   Adding the ability to disable/enable input and output on the fly in
            the MIDI Clock and Input tabs.  Still in progress, though.
    -   Version 0.98.4:
        -   Fixed bug in recording-type selector in seqedit. Added a one-shot
            reset option.
        -   Fixed some metadata problems as per issue #75.
        -   Fixed an issue with the H:M:S display being changed by changing the
            beat-width, a bug going back to Seq24's JACK transport support.
        -   MIDI API refactoring for the future; detecting JACK port
            registration.
    -   Version 0.98.3.1:
        -   Revisited issue #45. Doh!
        -   Cleaned up the Makefiles, fixed minor issues.
    -   Version 0.98.3:
        -   Fixed issue #76.  Fixed broken MIDI Start handling. Added setting
            the tempo via a tempo event.  Still thinking about MMC.
        -   Fixed old bug in showing note events; they were filtered by the
            pattern-configured channel!
        -   Tweaks to style-sheet handling.
        -   Fixed misuses of msgprintf(). Other minor bug fixes.
        -   In a new NSM session, do not load the most-recent MIDI file, even
            if specified in the imported configuration.  Also, no longer do an
            automatic import of the home configuration to the NSM configuration.
            Instead, use the "File / Import / Import Project" menu entry.
            See the user manual for how this works.
        -   Added a "File / Import / Import Playlist" command.
            See the user manual for how this works.
        -   Made virtual port names in ALSA more consistent. Also create the
            ports (in JACK, too) even if disabled.  Still experimental.
        -   Added Preferences item for the BPM Precision setting.
        -   Added contrib/code/ametro.c to provide ALSA test for MIDI clocking.
        -   Added GNU -finstrument-functions support, but too problematic.
    -   Version 0.98.2:
        -   Fixed issue #74, where -1 for "no buss-override" was being converted
            to 0.
        -   Added detection of missing system ports when mapping ports.
        -   Song duration label is now a button to select time versus measures.
        -   Removed useless flags for loading keystroke and MIDI controls.
        -   Avoid applying mute-group 0 if song has triggers and song-mode is
            'auto'.
        -   Fixes to log-file handling.
        -   Added "Blank" for disabling keystrokes in the 'ctrl' file.
    -   Version 0.98.1:
        -   Work on creating an NSIS installer for a 64-bit Windows build.
        -   Fixed a stupid segfault bug with the --help option.  Doh!
        -   Changed some extended automation keys (for grid modes).
        -   Minor fixes: (1) Set to set 0 when opening a MIDI file; (2) Expand a
            pattern when merging a longer one into it; (3) fixed pattern access
            in sets > 0; (4) fixed an error in string tokenization.
        -   Fixes for port-mapping and naming; if present, the user sets the
            status of the port-map, which is copied to the matching port.
        -   Fixes in song-editor set-names display.
        -   Removed unused module qskeymaps.
    -   Version 0.98.0:
        -   Fixed issue #41 "Hide Seq66 on closing window" via a "visibility"
            automation command and by fixing the response to "hide/show"
            messages from NSM. Note that the NSM API permits the "Quit" command
            to exit the application. Also see the comments at issue #64 "NSM: UI
            show up after restarting the app".
        -   Fixed issue #73 "Compile error because of jack_get_version_string"
            by detecting the presence of this function in configure.ac.
        -   Truly fixed high CPU usage in Windows version of the condition
            variable "wait".  Replaced pthread implementation with C++'s
            condition_variable.
        -   Added "MIDI macros" to the 'ctrl' file.  Can send SysEx or other
            messages from a drop-down list; automatic startup and exit messages.
            More to come.
        -   Added a feature to extract JACK port aliases and show them
            to the user so that the system port can be associated with a named
            device (e.g. "Launchpad-Mini").
        -   Added api_sysex() overrides, at last.
        -   Added Preference items for MIDI control I/O.
        -   Improved the display of the MIDI file-name in title and live grid.
        -   Improving grid-mode functionality, adding more automation controls,
            in progress.
    -   Version 0.97.3:
        -   Added pattern-recording indicator to live-grid slots.
        -   Replace useless "Record" automation command with a "Loop Mode"
            command to move between normal loop mode in the Live grid to various
            record-toggling modes:  Overdub (merge), Overwrite, Expand, and
            One-shot.
        -   Also refactored the quantize control to move through states of
        -   normal, quantize, and tighten.
        -   Refactored MIDI control for possible future usage of the D1 event
            value.
        -   Fixes to external live grid handling.
        -   Fixed the display of loop status changed via MIDI control.
        -   Fixed and updated the Windows build.  Mitigated high CPU usage
            when not (!) playing; fixed a bug in microsleep() for Windows.
    -   Version 0.97.2.1:
        -   Fixed odd breakage of loop-control hot-keys. Doh!
    -   Version 0.97.2:
        -   Issue #57: Increased width of option fields for wider fonts.
        -   Issue #58: Indicate if NSM is running in Preferences / Sessions and
            disable other session selections at that point.
        -   Issue #59: Spelling error(s) fixed.
        -   Issue #60: Added 'rc' option to disable JACK port auto connect in
            normal mode.  Also present in Preferences / JACK.
        -   Issue #61: Rearranged console output to show the app name, in color.
            Also turns off color if redirected to a file.
        -   Issue #63: Initial work on rotating numbering of patterns, sets, and
            mutes, so that numbers vary faster by column than by row.
        -   Issue #64: Fix a bug in optional GUI, testing with Agordejo (NSM).
        -   Added textfix.qss to make disabled text easier to read in themes.
        -   Improved the saving/restoring of Edit / Preferences.
        -   Added option "Bold Grid Slots" to make the progress bar and progress
            border thick, and the slot font bold.
        -   Added the ability to reload the configuration via a button press
            that restarts the application.
        -   More streamlining of configuration writing.
        -   No longer show the grid slot progress bar moving in muted tracks.
        -   Mute-group names now stored in the 'mutes' file.  Also able to edit
            them in the Mutes tab.  Also fixed botched mutes-in-MIDI-file
            handling.
        -   Removed dead-code from the event-editor frame.
        -   Changing behavior of external live frames for more flexibility.
    -   Version 0.97.1:
        -   Fixed a bad bug in displaying Notes in the data & event panels in
            the pattern editor, caused by premature ... optimization.
            per issue #61.
        -   Added working tempo-track code to Edit / Preferences / MIDI Clock.
        -   Added exponential ramping of Event Panel events to the pattern LFO
            dialog.
        -   Added the ability to move selected Event Panel events using the
            Left/Right arrow keys.
        -   Improved the handling of sets and external live grids.
        -   Updated documentation extensively. Optimized some images.
        -   Stopped bootstrap --full-clean from removing Makefile.in files.
    -   Version 0.97.0:
        -   Added limited vertical zoom to the song editor (performance roll).
            Still has vertical scroll issues.
        -   Added more Preferences settings, enabled some that were not yet
            implemented.  Upgraded the handling of the configuration files.
            By default, the 'rc' file is always saved, in case ports change.
        -   Added option "wrap-around" (for notes) to the 'usr' file.
        -   Added option "lock-main-window" to the 'usr' file to prevent
            resizing the window.
        -   Added code to show unlinked note events on the seqroll, the "u"
            key to remove them, and the "=" key to relink them.
        -   Added more build information to --version and Help / Build Info.
        -   Fixed drawing slot-button borders, drawn with no pattern color now.
        -   Got auto-scaling of the slot button font working.
        -   Implemented the Help / About links as per issue #21.
        -   Added OpenSUSE INSTALL notes from the sivecj/Seq66 fork.
        -   Improved the display and editing of tempo events, especially in the
            pattern editor. Also tightened handling of status values.
        -   Can now copy/paste a pattern from one MIDI file to another.
        -   Fixed minor bug in Import dialog handling.
        -   Refactoring for SMF 0 reading and export.
        -   Minor fix to flag changed tune (an asterisk).
    -   Version 0.96.3:
        -   Added ability to modify Note On and Note Off at the same time in the
            event editor. Fixed and updated event::get_rank().
        -   Fixed output port-map issue with lookup of "FLUID Synth". Removed
            the random ID number; search the port name via containment, not
            equality.
        -   Usage of the JACK Session API restored, though "deprecated".
            Removed all traces of LASH support. Added a configuration tab
            for allowing session management via JACK or NSM.
        -   Added an automation control for "save session".
    -   Version 0.96.2:
        -   Fixed issue #55, where the MIDI control channel was being stripped
            when using JACK.  Many other channel-handling improvements.
        -   Fixed a related issue: null (status = 0) control events were sent.
        -   Fixed a bug in "portmidi" MIDI input handling where only the last
            device events would be processed.
        -   Improved pause/continue support with JACK transport.
        -   Fixed 'rc' allow-click-edit feature.
        -   Made the buss-override settings act more consistently.
        -   Fixed the drawing of preview keys in virtual keyboard.
        -   Fixed setting the modify flag when opening existing pattern.
        -   Added settings interface for the "set mode" of playback.
        -   Added selection of notes and event by channel.
    -   Version 0.96.1:
        -   Restored drag and drop of patterns in the Live frame.
        -   Added the ability to copy all patterns in one set to another set.
        -   Fixed song-start-mode handling when "auto" is specified.
        -   Added "Control" and "Program" (GM) drop-downs in the event editor.
        -   Now display full path names in the recent file list to distinguish
            files better.  An 'rc' config item.
        -   Added a few configuration options to Edit / Preferences.
        -   Added 'usr' options to change the vertical offset of notes in the
            progress-box of each pattern button, and to provide default labeling
            of the piano keys.
        -   Tweaked the drawing of notes and drum notes.
        -   More work on set-handling.
        -   Fixed panic-button disabling Launchpad display output. However,
            if pressed before exit, the lights remain on and there is a slit
            delay in exiting the session (in ALSA; works fine in JACK).
    -   Version 0.96.0:
        -   Adding code to control the visibility of the main window; added
            a "Visibility" MIDI control option, and support for the
            "optional-gui" flag of the Non Session Manager.
        -   Fixed harmonic transposition settings.
        -   Fixed bug that drew fingerprint at top of button; and another bug
            that disabled showing the pattern if fingerprinting was disabled.
        -   Can now read MIDI files that are readable, but not writable, and
            disable File / Save as needed.
        -   Added hjkl arrow keys to seqroll and perfroll. Why? We have a
            Microsoft Arc keyboard with all the arrows on one small button.
        -   Fixed the Mixolydian mode scale. Oops.
        -   The pattern editor time, roll, data, and event frames line up.
        -   Fixed error reading mute-groups; small fixes to configuration files.
        -   Work on fitting pattern-editor in tab.
        -   Work on mitigating weird hang in QApplication destructor.
    -   Version 0.95.1:
        -   Added 'auto' option to song-start-mode setting.
        -   Added missing harmonic-transposition option to the pattern editor.
        -   Fixed issues with some of the file-dialogs.
        -   Fixed issues with editing keystrokes being passed from the tabbed
            editors to the main window (and the live frame).
        -   Improved arrow-key handling in seqroll.
        -   Removed PortMidi Java configuration parsing code.
        -   Important fixes to NSM sessions.
        -   Added 'one-shot' option the the 'usr' file record-style setting.
        -   Improved support for making the user-interface smaller; 4x4 sets.
        -   Added the "enigmatic" scale.
        -   Fixes to handling of musical key, scale, and background pattern.
        -   Finalized the scale-finder code (Ctrl-K in the pattern editor
            piano roll.)
        -   Updated libtool support, now seq66cli is under 200K in size.
        -   Removed QtWidget directory from qclocklayout #includes for issue
            #54.  Also added error-message and about to the Qt m4 file.
    -   Version 0.95.0:
        -   Updated almost all settings to use "name = variable" convention
            to improve readability.  This will change the format of config-files
            slightly upon exit.
        -   Fixes made to the sample Launchpad Mini 'ctrl' files.  Also added a
            "Quit" command, especially useful in a headless run.
        -   Added 8 "Alt" MIDI Control Out values to support special cases
            not covered by the concrete set of control-out values.
        -   Major cleanup and neatening of header files.
        -   Minor bugs and regressions fixed along the way.
        -   Loop-edit key will create a new sequence if slot is empty.
        -   Patterns empty of playable events no longer show unnecessary
            progress bars.
        -   The estimated duration of a tune is shown in the Song tab, based
            on pattern lengths and song triggers.
    -   Version 0.94.0:
        -   Major improvements to the stability of MIDI control of playlists.
        -   Added Phrygian scale thanks to user WinkoErades.
        -   Update the 'rc' file for a simpler specification of JACK MIDI and
            JACK transport.
        -   Removed the old-style live frame; use themes and style-sheets to
            create the old look if you like it.
        -   Removed a lot of debugging material of no use now.
        -   Fixed (mostly) a weird bug causing the application to hang
            on exit when set as JACK Master.  Pretty damn weird.
        -   Improving support for non-default PPQNs.
        -   Patterns can now be copied and merged into a new pattern to combine
            (for example) separate percussion tracks.
        -   Fixed error in playlist::verify() adding an empty list.
        -   Improving the handling of headless seq66cli; added a "quit"
            automation function for MIDI-only use.
        -   Fixed some issues with reading Cakewalk WRK files.
    -   Version 0.93.2:
        -   Changed the mute-group format inside the MIDI file to use a much
            less disk space (about 3K less).  Can be set in the 'rc' file to
            write the old format.
        -   Minor tweaks to the transposed-trigger functionality.  Can be set in
            the 'rc' file to write the old format.
        -   Removed the code for the essentially unused Seqtool application.
        -   Removed the now unnecessary old-style qseqeditframe.
        -   Add 'usr' tweaks options to change the size of the live-grid
            progress boxes, or eliminate them completely.
        -   Refactored keymaps for better progress on issue #47, using native
            key-codes. Added a spreadsheet listing the supported names of the
            keys.  Laid the groundwork for a 'keys' mapping file.
        -   Removed excess spurious events when Seq66 shuts down under JACK.
        -   Implemented the control-toggling of "follow JACK transport".
        -   Fixed a bug in the pattern editor that created unnecessary empty
            screen-sets.
        -   Further fixes and flexibility for handling mute-groups.
        -   Fixed the installation of libseq66 and libsession library header
            files in "make install" to preserve their base subdirectories.
            (The other libraries currently do not use base subdirectories.)
    -   Version 0.93.1:
        -   Work in progress on issue #47; added a keyboard-layout option to the
            'ctrl' file to disable auto-shift and tweak the internal key-map for
            some keyboards.  Added an "AZERTY" 'ctrl' file to the installation.
        -   Improved group-learn key control.
        -   Fixed issue #49, mute-group issues, plus a bug in saving mutes to
            the MIDI file.  Added a couple more flags to the 'mutes' file.
        -   Fixed issue #50, made the slot text color the same as the label
            color, and provided a "secret" default color that will cause the
            text to match the theme.  This can be overridden by a palette file.
        -   Fixed issue #51 (show-stopper!), where playback with JACK transport
            enable was extremely erratic on some platforms.
        -   Add clearing of the performer "play-set" for "File / New" to
            prevent the previous song from being playable. :-D
        -   Activate usage of (larger) seqedit frame in the "Edit" tab via
            a 'usr' option.  Adapted the size to better fit, but the user still
            needs to increase vertical dimension slightly to see the bottom
            buttons.  Will eventually eliminate the old version of the tabbed
            Edit frame.
        -   Fixed a bug in drawing notes as a new one is recorded; needed to
            "verify-and-link".
        -   Added a loop-count for live playback of a pattern.  0 means normal
            infinite looping; 1 means "one-shot"; and higher numbers will work.
            Stored with the pattern in the MIDI file.
    -   Version 0.93.0:
        -   Added a transpose value to song editor triggers to support shifting
            patterns automatically during Song play.  Added an 'rc' option to
            save MIDI files using the original triggers.
        -   Improved the song editor vertical scrollbar, it adjusts to the
            number of actual sets.
        -   Added the L/R marker feature to the external pattern editor, and
            Song mode is no longer required to use it.  This makes it easier
            to explore a long pattern for extracting to a short pattern loop.
        -   Added more perfroll snap options, including one to force Seq24
            behavior.

            as the mouse moves over the pattern rows, useful for long songs.
        -   Fixed playback of ultra-long patterns due to not sleeping in the
            output loop (forgot to convert milliseconds to microseconds).
        -   Fixed vertical zoom in the pattern editor.
        -   Fixed a bad bug in writing Meta and SeqSpec data-lengths greater
            than 127.

            can be used to alter the appearance of the application beyond what
            a palette can do.  A sample 'qss' file is provided.
        -   Fixed PPQN modification, added user-interface and 'usr'
            configuration to change the default PPQN from 192.
        -   Fixed many issues with changing the time signature.
        -   Fixed creation of new configuration files.

        -   Improved handling of MIDI I/O control of Seq66.  Added more
            automation-display events, more testing.
        -   Updated documentation, including a ODF spreadsheet for the MIDI
            control configuration of the Launchpad Mini.
    -   Version 0.92.0:
        -   Fixed issue #34: "seq66 does not follow jack_transport tempo changes"
        -   Fixed issues with applying 'usr' buss and instrument names to the
            pattern-editor menus.
        -   Fixing serious issues with the event editor. Now deletes both
            linked notes.
        -   Added mute-group-out to show mutegroups on Launchpad Mini buttons.
        -   Tightened up mute-group handling, configuration file handling,

        -   Stream-line the format of the 'ctrl' file by removing columns for
            the values of "enabled" and "channel".  Will detect older formats
            and fix them.
        -   A PDF user manual is now provided in the doc directory, installed
            to /usr/local/share/doc/seq66-0.92 with "make install".
