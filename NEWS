2015-07-10 to 2021-09-20

This file collects major changes that are older and clutter up
the README file.  This file should be called "OLD NEWS".

    -   Version 0.96.3:
        -   Added ability to modify Note On and Note Off at the same time in the
            event editor. Fixed and updated event::get_rank().
        -   Fixed output port-map issue with lookup of "FLUID Synth". Removed
            the random ID number; search the port name via containment, not
            equality.
        -   Usage of the JACK Session API restored, though "deprecated".
            Removed all traces of LASH support. Added a configuration tab
            for allowing session management via JACK or NSM.
        -   Added an automation control for "save session".
    -   Version 0.96.2:
        -   Fixed issue #55, where the MIDI control channel was being stripped
            when using JACK.  Many other channel-handling improvements.
        -   Fixed a related issue: null (status = 0) control events were sent.
        -   Fixed a bug in "portmidi" MIDI input handling where only the last
            device's events would be processed.
        -   Improved pause/continue support with JACK transport.
        -   Fixed 'rc' allow-click-edit feature.
        -   Made the buss-override settings act more consistently.
        -   Fixed the drawing of preview keys in virtual keyboard.
        -   Fixed setting the modify flag when opening existing pattern.
        -   Added settings interface for the "set mode" of playback.
        -   Added selection of notes and event by channel.
    -   Version 0.96.1:
        -   Restored drag and drop of patterns in the Live frame.
        -   Added the ability to copy all patterns in one set to another set.
        -   Fixed song-start-mode handling when "auto" is specified.
        -   Added "Control" and "Program" (GM) drop-downs in the event editor.
        -   Now display full path names in the recent file list to distinguish
            files better.  An 'rc' config item.
        -   Added a few configuration options to Edit / Preferences.
        -   Added 'usr' options to change the vertical offset of notes in the
            progress-box of each pattern button, and to provide default labeling
            of the piano keys.
        -   Tweaked the drawing of notes and drum notes.
        -   More work on set-handling.
        -   Fixed panic-button disabling Launchpad display output. However,
            if pressed before exit, the lights remain on and there is a slit
            delay in exiting the session (in ALSA; works fine in JACK).
    -   Version 0.96.0:
        -   Adding code to control the visibility of the main window; added
            a "Visibility" MIDI control option, and support for the
            "optional-gui" flag of the Non Session Manager.
        -   Fixed harmonic transposition settings.
        -   Fixed bug that drew fingerprint at top of button; and another bug
            that disabled showing the pattern if fingerprinting was disabled.
        -   Can now read MIDI files that are readable, but not writable, and
            disable File / Save as needed.
        -   Added hjkl arrow keys to seqroll and perfroll. Why? We have a
            Microsoft Arc keyboard with all the arrows on one small button.
        -   Fixed the Mixolydian mode scale. Oops.
        -   The pattern editor time, roll, data, and event frames line up.
        -   Fixed error reading mute-groups; small fixes to configuration files.
        -   Work on fitting pattern-editor in tab.
        -   Work on mitigating weird hang in QApplication destructor.
    -   Version 0.95.1:
        -   Added 'auto' option to song-start-mode setting.
        -   Added missing harmonic-transposition option to the pattern editor.
        -   Fixed issues with some of the file-dialogs.
        -   Fixed issues with editing keystrokes being passed from the tabbed
            editors to the main window (and the live frame).
        -   Improved arrow-key handling in seqroll.
        -   Removed PortMidi Java configuration parsing code.
        -   Important fixes to NSM sessions.
        -   Added 'one-shot' option the the 'usr' file's record-style setting.
        -   Improved support for making the user-interface smaller; 4x4 sets.
        -   Added the "enigmatic" scale.
        -   Fixes to handling of musical key, scale, and background pattern.
        -   Finalized the scale-finder code (Ctrl-K in the pattern editor's
            piano roll.)
        -   Updated libtool support, now seq66cli is under 200K in size.
        -   Removed QtWidget directory from qclocklayout #includes for issue
            #54.  Also added error-message and about to the Qt m4 file.
    -   Version 0.95.0:
        -   Updated almost all settings to use "name = variable" convention
            to improve readability.  This will change the format of config-files
            slightly upon exit.
        -   Fixes made to the sample Launchpad Mini 'ctrl' files.  Also added a
            "Quit" command, especially useful in a headless run.
        -   Added 8 "Alt" MIDI Control Out values to support special cases
            not covered by the concrete set of control-out values.
        -   Major cleanup and neatening of header files.
        -   Minor bugs and regressions fixed along the way.
        -   Loop-edit key will create a new sequence if slot is empty.
        -   Patterns empty of playable events no longer show unnecessary
            progress bars.
        -   The estimated duration of a tune is shown in the Song tab, based
            on pattern lengths and song triggers.
    -   Version 0.94.0:
        -   Major improvements to the stability of MIDI control of playlists.
        -   Added Phrygian scale thanks to user WinkoErades.
        -   Update the 'rc' file for a simpler specification of JACK MIDI and
            JACK transport.
        -   Removed the old-style live frame; use themes and style-sheets to
            create the old look if you like it.
        -   Removed a lot of debugging material of no use now.
        -   Fixed (mostly) a weird bug causing the application to hang
            on exit when set as JACK Master.  Pretty damn weird.
        -   Improving support for non-default PPQNs.
        -   Patterns can now be copied and merged into a new pattern to combine
            (for example) separate percussion tracks.
        -   Fixed error in playlist::verify() adding an empty list.
        -   Improving the handling of headless seq66cli; added a "quit"
            automation function for MIDI-only use.
        -   Fixed some issues with reading Cakewalk WRK files.
    -   Version 0.93.2:
        -   Changed the mute-group format inside the MIDI file to use a much
            less disk space (about 3K less).  Can be set in the 'rc' file to
            write the old format.
        -   Minor tweaks to the transposed-trigger functionality.  Can be set in
            the 'rc' file to write the old format.
        -   Removed the code for the essentially unused Seqtool application.
        -   Removed the now unnecessary old-style qseqeditframe.
        -   Add 'usr' tweaks options to change the size of the live-grid
            progress boxes, or eliminate them completely.
        -   Refactored keymaps for better progress on issue #47, using native
            key-codes. Added a spreadsheet listing the supported names of the
            keys.  Laid the groundwork for a 'keys' mapping file.
        -   Removed excess spurious events when Seq66 shuts down under JACK.
        -   Implemented the control-toggling of "follow JACK transport".
        -   Fixed a bug in the pattern editor that created unnecessary empty
            screen-sets.
        -   Further fixes and flexibility for handling mute-groups.
        -   Fixed the installation of libseq66 and libsession library header
            files in "make install" to preserve their base subdirectories.
            (The other libraries currently don't use base subdirectories.)
    -   Version 0.93.1:
        -   Work in progress on issue #47; added a keyboard-layout option to the
            'ctrl' file to disable auto-shift and tweak the internal key-map for
            some keyboards.  Added an "AZERTY" 'ctrl' file to the installation.
        -   Improved group-learn key control.
        -   Fixed issue #49, mute-group issues, plus a bug in saving mutes to
            the MIDI file.  Added a couple more flags to the 'mutes' file.
        -   Fixed issue #50, made the slot text color the same as the label
            color, and provided a "secret" default color that will cause the
            text to match the theme.  This can be overridden by a palette file.
        -   Fixed issue #51 (show-stopper!), where playback with JACK transport
            enable was extremely erratic on some platforms.
        -   Add clearing of the performer's "play-set" for "File / New" to
            prevent the previous song from being playable. :-D
        -   Activate usage of (larger) seqedit frame in the "Edit" tab via
            a 'usr' option.  Adapted the size to better fit, but the user still
            needs to increase vertical dimension slightly to see the bottom
            buttons.  Will eventually eliminate the old version of the tabbed
            Edit frame.
        -   Fixed a bug in drawing notes as a new one is recorded; needed to
            "verify-and-link".
        -   Added a loop-count for live playback of a pattern.  0 means normal
            infinite looping; 1 means "one-shot"; and higher numbers will work.
            Stored with the pattern in the MIDI file.
    -   Version 0.93.0:
        -   Added a transpose value to song editor triggers to support shifting
            patterns automatically during Song play.  Added an 'rc' option to
            save MIDI files using the original triggers.
        -   Improved the song editor's vertical scrollbar, it adjusts to the
            number of actual sets.
        -   Added the L/R marker feature to the external pattern editor, and
            Song mode is no longer required to use it.  This makes it easier
            to explore a long pattern for extracting to a short pattern loop.
        -   Added more perfroll snap options, including one to force Seq24
            behavior.
        -   Make the perf-names now also show the pattern color. They highlight
            as the mouse moves over the pattern rows, useful for long songs.
        -   Fixed playback of ultra-long patterns due to not sleeping in the
            output loop (forgot to convert milliseconds to microseconds).
        -   Fixed vertical zoom in the pattern editor.
        -   Fixed a bad bug in writing Meta and SeqSpec data-lengths greater
            than 127.
        -   Enhanced the event editor to work with channel-less tracks.
        -   Added channel and bus menus to the grid-button popup menu.
    -   Version 0.92.2:
        -   Added a Qt "style-sheet" configuration it to the 'usr' file. It
            can be used to alter the appearance of the application beyond what
            a palette can do.  A sample 'qss' file is provided.
        -   Fixed PPQN modification, added user-interface and 'usr'
            configuration to change the default PPQN from 192.
        -   Fixed many issues with changing the time signature.
        -   Fixed creation of new configuration files.
        -   Fixed port-mapping for MIDI output, control, and status display.
        -   Removed the external set-master; use the set-master tab.
        -   Tightened meta-events and set-handling.
        -   More fixes to Song recording; added a Snap button for it.
        -   Fixed the rendering of the beat indicator and pattern fonts.
        -   Updated the man pages and the documentation.
    -   Version 0.92.1:
        -   Fixed issue #42 by adding scrollbars to I/O lists in Preferences
            when there are many ports on the system; also increased port
            limits to 48 ports.
        -   Fixed issues with iterating through MIDI events in the
            user-interfaces.
        -   Big fixes to Song recording. More to do?
        -   Added an experimental one-shot auto-step step-edit feature for
            recording (for example) drumbeats from MIDI devices.
        -   Fixed bug in parsing Fluidsynth port names.
        -   Improved handling of MIDI I/O control of Seq66.  Added more
            automation-display events, more testing.
        -   Updated documentation, including a ODF spreadsheet for the MIDI
            control configuration of the Launchpad Mini.
    -   Version 0.92.0:
        -   Fixed issue #34: "seq66 does not follow jack_transport tempo changes"
        -   Fixed issues with applying 'usr' buss and instrument names to the
            pattern-editor menus.
        -   Fixing serious issues with the event editor. Now deletes both
            linked notes.
        -   Added mute-group-out to show mutegroups on Launchpad Mini buttons.
        -   Tightened up mute-group handling, configuration file handling,
            play-list handling, and MIDI display device handling.
        -   Stream-line the format of the 'ctrl' file by removing columns for
            the values of "enabled" and "channel".  Will detect older formats
            and fix them.
        -   A PDF user manual is now provided in the doc directory, installed
            to /usr/local/share/doc/seq66-0.92 with "make install".
    -   Version 0.91.6:
        -   Massively updated the Mutes tab.
        -   More documentation.

    -   Version 0.91.5:
        -   Added vertical zoom to the pattern editor (V keys and buttons).
        -   Added more control over the coloring of notes.
        -   Still improving the port-mapper feature.
        -   Added quotes to file-paths in the 'rc' configuration file.
        -   Many fixes to seqedit, perfedit.  Way too many to mention them
            all.  Changed the 4/4 and length selections to be editable.
        -   Getting serious about rewriting the user manual in this project.
    -   Version 0.91.4:
        -   Improved port naming and provide an option for short or long port
            names.
        -   Improved safety in NSM sessions.
        -   Major refactoring the color handling.  Colors have changed!!!
    -   Version 0.91.3:
        -   Added check to not apply last mute-group if in Song mode.
        -   Provisional support for playing multiple sets at once and for
            auto-arming the selected set when loaded.
        -   Added a configurable number for virtual MIDI input/output ports.
        -   Provides an option to for multiple-set playback and auto-arming
            of a newly-selected set.
        -   Fixed bug in string-to-int conversion uncovered by automatic
            mute-group restore.

        -   Added a button to toggle insert mode in pattern and song editors.
        -   Robustness enhancement to NSM support.
    -   Version 0.91.0:
        -   Non Session Manager support essentially complete.  The
            refactoring to do this was massive.
        -   All too many bug fixes and minor improvements.
        -   Added --copy-dt-needed-entries to qseq66 Makefile.am to fix
            linkage errors that cropped up in debug builds.
        -   Got the CLI version building, needs a lot of testing.
        -   Playlist editing from the user-interface much improved.
    -   Version 0.90.6:

    -   Version 0.90.5:
        -   More refactoring to improve Windows builds and fix deadlocks and
            playback on a default Windows 10 install.
        -   Added code to implement Song/Live and JACK Transport key toggles.
        -   MIDI control improved for control and for status display by
            devices like the Launchpad Mini, using new "ctrl" files.
        -   Fixes:
            -   Fixed a bug using millitime() instead of microtime().
            -   Issue #13, data and event/trigger panes not reflecting event
                changes.  Change handling improved in general with more
                performer callbacks.

            working in Live mode and Song mode.
        -   Fixed issues with perfoll and grid-button rendering, synch between
            button and seqedit mute status, growing notes in the seqroll, and
            more.
        -   Added writing of blank [midi-control-out] section.
        -   Fixed flickering when muting/unmuting patterns via keystrokes.
