TO DO for Seq66 0.95.1 (Sequencer64 refactored for C++14 and Qt)
Chris Ahlstrom
2019-04-13 to 2021-06-23

Port-Mapping:

    Running qpseq66 on Linux:  "QSynth" is named "PortMidi"! See
    seq_portmidi/src/midibus.cpp.  The workaround is to specify long port
    names in the 'rc' file.

UI:

    The Event Pane also does not perform as documented.  Need to be able
    to edit in it similarly to the piano roll. It is not really practical to
    edit Note-Ons and Note-Offs in the event editor.  However, one can now
    delete linked notes with one command.

    See the mouse wheel scroll event requests for both the song and
    pattern editors.

    The "L" and "R" markers do not work correctly in the seqedit; also seems
    to cause start/stop to become disabled, as JACK master.

    Can we reset the main port dropdown to 0 when loading a new song?

Automation:

    Tap BPM key (F9) works now, but it should cause the Tap BPM button to
    show the tap count.

    Can we leverage continuous controllers (CC) to support modifying synth
    parameters through input automation?

From Testing:

    Investigation Windows installer versus portable package for 0.95.0.

    Make sure MIDI import does not import the SeqSpec sections of a Seq66
    MIDI file.

    When loading the recent files list: (1) eliminate files that no longer
    exist; (2) figure out how to display files that differ only in path.

    When zooming, try to keep the same viewport in view.  Got this working
    for horizontal seqroll and perfroll, but not for vertical (refactoring
    needed).

    Try to center vertically on notes in the viewport.

    When muting/unmuting a pattern in the song editor, when focus changes
    the tracks are shown in the bright color.

    Time-zoom and seqroll zoom can get out of sync.  Workaround: move the
    scrollbar to beginning.

    Can we distinguish note-insertion from movement snap, to avoid the
    "L"-then-snap-then-move mamba?

    Tempo display needs to be worked on for the perfroll and qloopbuttons.

    Consider a configurable metronome functionality.  In seqtime?

Others to Consider:

    When filling the file line in the live grid with the MIDI filename (not
    from playlist), use the realpath() result.

    In main frame, try to highlight the start/stop/pause buttons
    appropriately.

EXTANT ISSUES:

#1  JACK Metadata MIDINAM support.  LV2 MIDNAM has been around for a
    while. There has been discussion on #lad, and, now JACK 2 has metadata
    implemented, Carla has started offering that MIDNAM information as
    metadata on the midi-in port for a connecting sequencer to use.
    STATUS: Not yet started.

#2  Failed to find matching components of a complete QT installation
    STATUS: Closed.

#3  Open loop Pattern Editor window.
    On mouse wheel scroll event we expect the piano-roll and notes sheet to
    scroll vertically.
    STATUS: We had to disable mouse-wheel scrolling for this reason: In
    qseqkeys, we did not want the scroll wheel to accidentally scroll the
    piano keys vertically.  Same for qscrollmaster, qseqeditframe64, except
    that we note wheelEvent() is not called for some reason.  One way around
    this issue might be to some pass child scrolling up to the qscrollmaster
    class.

#4  segfault on closing pattern editor
    STATUS: Closed.

#5  "Resume playback of notes on sequence toggle" option doesn't work/save
    STATUS: Closed.

#6  Build fails without lash.h
    STATUS: Closed.

#7  make install doesn't install files
    STATUS: Closed.

#8  NSM support?
    STATUS: Closed.

#9  Change pattern in the Edit tab while on the Edit tab?
    STATUS: Closed.

#10 Right click-hold on pattern editor doesn't show draw pencil
    STATUS: Closed.

#11 Pattern editor: disabling the 'piano roll scrolls with playback'
	     button does not stop the scrolling
    STATUS: Closed.

#12 Note rendering problem.
    Having a long note, scrolling it out of vision and back again leads to a
    problem.  (Only the first snap division and last snap division of the note
    appears.
    STATUS:  Weird, will do.  Might be fixed by the verify-and-link fix.

#13 Pattern editor: control event bar doesn't update/scroll
    STATUS: Closed.

#14 Build issue in Linux
    STATUS: Closed.

#15 Crash when closing Set Window
    STATUS: Closed.

#16 Ableton Live transport support?
    Go to this issue in Github to see the thread.

#17 Connect midi devices by name
    Currently midi devices are mapped by bus number. This is a problem when
    devices are added and removed, which happens a lot for me. Why not storing
    and connecting midi devices by name instead?
    This could even be backwards-compatible: when the configuration file has a
    bus number, use that, if it is a string, connect by name.
    STATUS:  A "port-mapping" configuation in the 'rc' file is now supported.
    Mostly tested; works for patterns and for MIDI I/O control.

#18 Mute Group does not toggle
    Also I have noticed that when I activate a mute group I am not able to
    activate patterns that do not belong to the activated mute group. It is
    normal?
    STATUS: I want to double-check this one.  This may now be fixed via
    fixes for issue #49.

#19 Crash when recording note
    STATUS: Closed.

#20 JackClient::Execute error name = seq66_transport
    STATUS: Closed.

#21 Wrong links in about dialog
    STATUS: Closed.  It would be good to work up a way to open the link
    in the default browser.

#22 Arch Linux PKGBUILD file for seq66
    STATUS: Closed.

#23 Problems with Qt during compilation
    STATUS: Closed.

#24 Release notes in release tag message?
    I would like to add seq66 to https://libreav.org/updates
    Could I request that the release change notes are used in the release
    message? Then they could be syndicated via the releases.atom.
    Either using the release description box in the Create Release feature on
    GitHub (which can accept markdown) or with something like git tag -a v0.4
    -m "$(cat RELNOTES.md)" (which GH does not detect markdown from).
    Might it be possible to edit
    (https://github.com/ahlstromcj/seq66/releases) to pop the release notes
    in?  It's just that it's time sensitive as GitHub has [malformed
    releases.atom feeds] (https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/1892) that
    only have an updated  date not a published date, so any change to the
    release details will change the date in the feed that is used by
    libreav.org.  STATUS: Not sure this is worth doing. Do not know about
    "atom".

#25 Configure fails
    STATUS: Closed.

#26 Freeze/crash after selecting 'Import into session'
    STATUS: Closed.

#27 NSM: pattern state isn't recalled with session
    STATUS: Closed.

#28 (Deleted?)

#29 Play patterns from different sets at the same time
    STATUS: Provisional support in 0.91.3.  One more feature to add soon.

#30 Managing pattern colors with a pallette
    STATUS: Closed.

#31 Pattern text readability on bright backgrounds
    STATUS: Closed.

#32 NSM: save session
    STATUS: Needs retests.

#33 NSM not working here
    STATUS:  Will start retesting soon.

    I add a new pattern, add a couple notes, then click File / Save to
    save the tune.  It DOES NOT save the tune, because at that point it
    does not have a name.  [I consider this to be a BUG, there should be a
    default file-name already in place, or a prompt for a filename.]

    I edit an in-session config to load the latest file, which is not part
    of the session.  Seq66 does not get to the UI when first starting the
    session.  It does do it the next time, loading the file.  The actual
    operation should be in import, I think.

#34 seq66 doesn't follow jack_transport tempo changes (and so also doesn't
    work with jack_link)
    STATUS: Fixed, needs a retest.

#35 NSM: Being able to edit session parameters manually, not according to NSM
    API.
    STATUS: Fixed, needs a retest.

#36 README doesn't describe seq66
    STATUS: Closed.

#37 Song editor scrolling?
    STATUS: To be investigated.

#38 seq66/sequencer64 choice
    STATUS: Closed.

#39 Arm Build - Pattern editor does not open
    STATUS:  Should be closed.  Will try it myself on a Pi soon.

#40 NSM: seq66 in a new session should provide a blank project
    Currently it imports the previously used MIDI file.

#41 NSM: hide seq66 on closing window, do not exit?
    If closing the window, rather than quitting the app, could change the its
    visibility state to hidden.

#42 MIDI Input window doesn't handle large port counts
    STATUS: Closed.

#43 Extended MIDI Format / Type?
    STATUS: Should close, it was a nomenclature/documentation issue.

#44 "Record live sequence changes" functionality
    Currently the "record live sequence changes" only adds patterns into the
    song timeline as whole loops, starting at the last pattern loop and ending
    at the next, and ignoring queueing completely (queueing a pattern just
    adds it to the song immediately). It seems to me that a live-oriented
    sequencer like Seq66 should have the ability to record a live performance
    as accurately as possible, so that a user can simply hit the record enable
    and do their live performance, knowing that can then go back and replay it
    exactly (if they want to do a recording session for example, or perform
    the same track while focussing entirely on knob tweaking etc.) The song
    timeline already supports arbitrary start/end points for pattern "chunks",
    so it seems like this should already be possible. Thoughts?

#45 data/Makefile.am does not respect DESTDIR
    STATUS: Closed.

#46 JACK port groups / order?

#47 change key map
    STATUS: Done.  May need to add a new "keymap" file to handle further
    requests for non-US keyboards.

#48 JACK-midi self connections
    With NSM and [manual ports] enabled, inputs ports are not created when I
    load the session.  Steps to reproduce :

      * Create a NSM session with a jack-patch.
      * Add qseq66
      * Save and quit the session
      * Change .rc file in the session folder to enable [manual-ports], then
        save the file.
      * Open your NSM session, use MIDI-input preference to create ports,
        then make connections.
      * Save and reload the session.

    Also, [manual-ports] is off, then seq66 handles connections. IMO, this
    behavior should be disabled with NSM, because a session manager is
    supposed to store/restore the connections.

    (I have used Ray-Session , but I guess it acts as others NSM managers)

    Note:  Probably need an option to not auto-connect ehile NSM is running.

#49 Unable to unmute loops after group learn.
    STATUS: Done.  Needs more testing.

#50 White text on Yellow is unreadable
    STATUS: Done.  See issues #30 and #31.  This should be user-correctable
    using the "palette" file and perhaps a Qt style-sheet.

#51 Unreliable MIDI playback
    STATUS: Done.  Always needs testing when something is changed that affects
    the JACK Transport feature.

#52 Community / discussion place?
    STATUS: See the thread on GitHub.

#53 MIDI CC sequencing
    STATUS: See the thread on GitHub.

PATTERNS:

    -   Set pattern editor focus to grid at start unless it is a new one.
    -   Make it center on notes if not visible.
    -   Still some weird note events in 2rock, above measure 20, when scrolling
        via the scrollbar; okay when clicking the scrollbar. Fine when scrolling
        during playback.
    -   Make sure Esc/Space work in pattern editor.  Consider adding the
        start/stop buttons to external windows (song and pattern).
    -   When loading 2rock pattern 10(1) into the editor, adjust the length
        dropdown to match!

Tons of TO DOs in performer!

    Load a song with Song triggers; go to the song tab; select File/New. Note
    that the perfroll clears, but not the perfnames!  We need to derive all
    qperf GUIs from qperfbase.  Actually, they both clear, only if clicked on.

    When copying a large track and pasting into a smaller one, consider altering
    the length of the smaller track to match.  We have implented a Merge
    Pattern facility.
