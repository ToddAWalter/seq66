 *
 *  Gtkmm 2.4 and Qt 5 handle keystrokes in a somewhat different manner.
 *  However, in Seq66 there is no more support for Gtkmm, so that this module is
 *  stripped of the conversion functions.  If you still want to know about the
 *  mapping between the two frameworks, see this qskeymaps module in the
 *  Sequencer64 project.
 *
 *  The Seq66 keystroke handling has the following features:
 *
 *      -#  The conventional ASCII character set is handled as norma, with
 *          values in the range of ' ' (32 or 0x20) up to '~' (126 or 0x7e).
 *      -#  Most special characters and keystroke modifiers are detected and
 *          are in the range of 0xFF00 and up.
 *      -#  Keys that might have nominally the same function are nonetheless
 *          distinguished.  For example, all the keys on the keypad section of
 *          the keyboard have unique unsigned code numbers.  For each key, the
 *          number is different between having Num-Lock on or not.  All
 *          numbers, even those for the ASCII characters '0' to '9' and '/',
 *          '*', '+', '-', and '.', are in the range of 0xff00 and up, and
 *          not in the range 0x2a to to 0x39.
 *
 *  For Qt 5 keystrokes, this level of distinguishing the characters from
 *  their keyboard keys is not done.  Qt 5 allows two ways to retrieve key
 *  events: QKeyEvent::key() and QKeyEvent::text().  For ASCII keys, these
 *  functions yield the same value, the ASCII value of the
 *  character/keystroke.  For special keys, however, QKeyEvent::key() returns
 *  number from 0x01000000 on up, and QKeyEvent::text() yields only 0x00.
 *  Also, the key() function doesn't distinguish between upper and lower case
 *  keys, so the text() function must be used.
