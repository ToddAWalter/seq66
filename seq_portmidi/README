README for seq_portmidi Library

2017-08-28 to 2019-01-24

This directory provides library code that I call "portmini" to myself.
The Seq24 project could use the PortMIDI library in Linux or Windows.
However, for our port to Windows, we want to use our own cut-down version of
PortMIDI, so we do not have to deal with Java, CMake, and other stuff the
Seq66 does not need.  So we have removed the pm_csharp, pm_dylib, and
pm_java directories, cleaned up the code a bit, and added automake support.
