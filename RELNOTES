Release Notes for Seq66 v. 0.99.16 2024-11-26

Fixes for NSM (session manager), build-file updates, and better PPQN
and recording handling.

- Fixed issue #128 with expanded recording not working. The expansion
  is now continual, not waiting for a MIDI key to be struck.
- Merged a fix from a pull request (issue #130) to update the
  "*.desktop" files.
- Fixed issue #131 re faulty NSM interactions introduced in version
  0.99.11, plus other related issues:
  - NSM (agordejo or nsm-legacy-gui) would show two clients: "qseq66"
    and "seq66" when adding only the "qseq66" client.
  - Saving via a remote NSM Save command or by the File / Save menu
    would not clear the modified flag.
  - Closing the session would not remove any external editor windows.
- Some automation actions need to work whether the action is "on" or
  "toggle". Fixed these 'ctrl' actions:
  - Save session (under NSM) or the MIDI file.
  - Record style select.
  - Quit.
- Fixed the display of tunes with various PPQNs such as 120 in the
  pattern editor.
- Added "Clear events" to the grid slot popup menu.
- Enhancements to pattern-editor note copy/paste.
- Added 120 PPQN to the list of supported PPQNs.
- Fixed File / New plus File Save overwriting the previous loaded
  file.
- The main window now reflects the current record-loop style and
  new-pattern option as read from the 'usr' file. But note:
- Renamed [new-pattern-editor] to [pattern-editor] in the 'usr' file.
- The Quantized Record button in the pattern editor steps through
  None, Tighten, Quantize, Notemap, None.... Prettied-up the icons,
  too.
- Added CONFIG\_DIR\_NAME and cleaned up configure.ac. This macro
  differentiates between client name and config directory name.
  Updated the Makefile sources. Do "./bootstrap --full-clean".
- Updated the PDF documentation re the Import/Export functionality.
- See NEWS and ChangeLog for more details.
