Release Notes for Seq66 v. 0.99.5 2023-05-18

This file lists __major__ changes from version 0.99.5

    -   Issue #110 Windows: Fixed many errors, added installer to this release,
        no more going to the sequencer64 repository. Can build installer in
        Windows now.
    -   Fixed portmidi bugs in Linux and Windows, enhanced device naming.
    -   Greatly enhanced the event editor tab and the events that can
        be view and modified.
    -   Made port-mapping the default. At first startup the map exactly matches
        the existing ports; can be changed in the 'rc' file or Preferences dialog.
    -   Eliminated "missing ctrl" message at first startup.
    -   Fixed port ID setting in midibus, and adding output flag in midi_alsa_info.
    -   Internal refactoring to regularize handling of the session/config
        directory between Linux and Windows.
    -   Showing disabled/unavailable MIDI devices as grayed in various dropdowns.
    -   Rearranged the Seq66 man pages more sensibly.

Read the NEWS, README.md, and TODO files.  Never-ending!
