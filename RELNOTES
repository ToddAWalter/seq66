Release Notes for Seq66 v. 0.99.12 2024-01-13

-   Fixed clang support and FreeBSD builds.
    -   Using clang-12 and clang-16 to find errors and warnings
        that g++ did not detect, re issue #124.
    -   Modifying configure.ac and make-files to support this
        compiler. However, it does not define QT_CXXFLAGS and
        QT_LIBS in FreeBSD. Therefore...
    -   ... Added a qbuild.sh script to replace the old qbuild (bash)
        script and to be used instead of autotools in FreeBSD.
    -   Seq66 builds and runs, but currently detects only software
        MIDI ports running under JACK.
-   Added an autogen.sh script to use with basic UNIX shells like
    dash.
-   Fixed the processing of SysEx and Meta events.
    -   Reading and writing in the MIDI file upgraded.
    -   Display SysEx and text in the event editor.
    -   Added new 'rc' option to skip, recover, or abort from bad
        running status in MIDI files. See the trilogy.mid contributed
        file.
    -   Handle unterminated SysEx messages (Dixie04.mid).
-   Fixed issue with building the command-line version with "portmidi".
-   Fixed a one-character buffer overflow in portmidi.c. Thanks,
    valgrind!
-   Fixed bugs in --option log=file.
-   Fixed Q button not working to set keep-queue status.
-   Fixed queued-solo functionality.
-   Upgraded the Event editor Dump output.
-   Disabled the grid-solo option as redundant.
