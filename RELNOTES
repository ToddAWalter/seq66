Release Notes for Seq66 v. 0.99.16 2024-11-08

Fixes for NSM (session manager), build-file updates, and better PPQN
handling.

- Merged a fix from a pull request (issue #130) to update the
  *.desktop files.
- Fixed issue #131 re faulty NSM interactions introduced in version
  0.99.11, plus other related issues:
  - NSM (agordejo or nsm-legacy-gui) would show two clients: "qseq66"
    and "seq66" when adding only the "qseq66" client.
  - Saving via a remote NSM Save command or by the File / Save menu
    would not clear the modified flag.
  - Closing the session would not remove any external editor windows.
- Some automation actions need to work whether the action is "on" or
  "toggle". Fixed these 'ctrl' actions:
  - Save session (under NSM) or the MIDI file.
  - Record style select.
  - Quit.
- Fixed the display of tunes with various PPQNs such as 120 in the
  pattern editor.
- Added 120 PPQN to the list of supported PPQNs.
- Added CONFIG\_DIR\_NAME and cleaned up configure.ac. This macro
  differentiates between client name and config directory name.
  Updated the Makefile sources. Do "./bootstrap --full-clean".
- Updated the PDF documentation re the Import/Export functionality.
- See NEWS and ChangeLog for more details.

Note: No Windows installer provided for this release.
