Release Notes for Seq66 v. 0.99.12 2023-12-28

-   Fixed clang support and FreeBSD builds.
    -   Using clang-12 and clang-16 to find errors and warnings
        that g++ did not detect, re issue #124.
    -   Modifying configure.ac and make-files to support this
        compiler. However, it does not define QT_CXXFLAGS and
        QT_LIBS in FreeBSD. Therefore...
    -   ... Added a qbuild.sh script to replace the old qbuild (bash)
        script and to be used instead of autotools in FreeBSD.
-   Fixed the processing of SysEx and Meta events.
    -   Reading and writing in the MIDI file upgraded.
    -   Display SysEx and text in the event editor.
    -   Added new 'rc' option to skip, recover, or abort from bad running
        status in MIDI files. See the trilogy.mid contributed file.
    -   Handle unterminated SysEx messages (Dixie04.mid).
-   Fixed issue with building the command-line version with "portmidi"
    (seq66clip).
-   Fixed bugs in --option log=file.
-   Fixed Q button not working to set keep-queue status.
-   Fixed a one-character buffer overflow in portmidi.c.
