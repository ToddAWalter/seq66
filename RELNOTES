Release Notes for Seq66 v. 0.99.6 2023-07-01

This file lists __major__ changes from version 0.99.6

    -   Issue #3 follow-ons:
        -   Pattern editor panes stay in sync with the piano roll using
            the hjkl, arrow, and page keys. Scroll wheel works in
            the piano roll.
    -   Issue #110 follow-ons:
        -   Addition of Start menu entries for Windows.
        -   Fixed access to the tutorial and manual.
        -   data/readme & doc/tutorial files fixed for NSIS installer.
        -   Fixed the saving of modified tempo changes.
        -   Fixed changing note velocities in the pattern editor data
            pane.  Improved velocity-change undo.
        -   Fixed error preventing changing the "background" pattern.
        -   Remaining issue: Building 32-bit (Windows XP) version on
            64-bit Windows.
    -   Issue #111:
        -   Added support for editing, storing, and displaying time
            signatures in the pattern and event editors.
        -   The first time-signature in a pattern becomes the main
            time signature of the pattern.
        -   The data pane shows a time-signature as a simple fraction.
        -   Changing the time signature if at time 0 is automatic.
        -   Time signatures at later times are logged by setting the
            current time with a click in the top half of the time line,
            changing the beats and beat width, then clicking a
            time-sig log button.
        -   Non-MIDI-standard beat-widths are supported as a
            Seq66-specific "event".
        -   Fixed event filtering in the event (qstriggereditor) pane.
        -   As time-signatures change, Seq66 adjusts the piano roll,
            time line (with measure counts), and event pane vertical
            lines.
    -   Port-mapping prompts about port issues and allows an immediate
        remap-and-restart.
    -   'o' keystroke in seqroll toggles recording ('r' already
        taken).
    -   Added a "quiet" option to not show startup message prompts.
    -   A log-file is now created by default & kept under a megabyte.
    -   Added the pattern port number to the Song Summary output.
    -   A large number of fixes of unrelated issues.
