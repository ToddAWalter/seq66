/**
 * \file          app_limits.h
 *
 *  This module holds macro constants related to the application limits of
 *  Seq66.

 * \library       seq66 application

 *
 *  This collection of macros describes some facets of the
 *  "Patterns Panel" or "Sequences Window", which is visually presented by
 *  the Gtk::Window-derived class called mainwnd (now qsmainwnd in the Qt 5
 *  version of the application.
 *
 *  The Patterns Panel contains an 8-by-4 grid of "pattern boxes" or
 *  "sequence boxes".  All of the patterns in this grid comprise what is
 *  called a "set" (in the musical sense) or a "screen set".
 *
 *  These macros also specify other parameters, as well.
 *
 *  Why do we use macros instead of const values?  First, it really doesn't
 *  matter for simple values.  Second, we want to follow the convention that
 *  important values are all upper-case, as is convention with most
 *  macros.  They just stand out more in code. Call us old school or old
 *  fools, you decide.  Hell, we still like snprintf() for some uses!
